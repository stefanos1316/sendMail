========================================
* Supervised learnining and standard algorithms
* ML is important but we should emphasis on deep learning
* Diverse tasks like small, medium, and large
* Different sample points (e.g., 1000, 5000, 10.000)
* Hyperparameters tuning: there are available libraries that can do that or empirically
* 4-5 ML frameworks


2020-09-03 Discussion with Maria Kechagia
=========================================

RQ1-2: break to two to test the energy and run-time performance separately.
RQ3: which algorithms are more energy efficient for certain tasks
RQ4: Hyperparameters

Selection criteria for ML algorithms:
1) Open Source
2) Active (commint no more than a year)
3) Popularity (GitHub start)
4) Evaluation (related work)
5) Documentation
6) Programming Languages (Python is the popular, therefore, we select only python frameworks, and python version)
7) Working tutorial
8) Evaluate on the same data

Selection of tasks:
* Machine translation
* NLP
*
