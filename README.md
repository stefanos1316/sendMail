# machine_learning_frameworks_analysis

Here we store everything related to the "An analysis on the energy and run-time performance of machine learning frameworks".
Below there are some points that we could fill in in order to help us in this research.


# Installation

First, install and create the virtual environment.

```bash
apt-get install python3-venv
cd frameworks
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To exit from the virtual environment just execute the `deactive` command.
To install all the necesary python packages execute the `pip3 install -e ".[deploy]"`
After installing all the python packages you can start executing
the deep learning algorithms.
Before executing the experiments make sure ot run the commands below or add them inside a script

```bash
sudo sh -c 'echo -1 >/proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid'
sudo sysctl -w kernel.perf_event_paranoid=-1
sudo bash /governor.sh pe
```



# Motivation

According to [1] the energy needed to train AI is now rising seven times
faster than ever before.
Therefore, selecting the proper algorithms to train and predict
could significantly reduce the monetary and environmental
impact of the IT sector.
Such a choice is even more paramount since the data-sets
are always increasing and more training is required to
precisely predict.
Moreover, once a model is trained, it is then used multiple
of times in the inference phase.
Therefore, it is important to evaluate the performance of the inference phase too.

# Research Questions

Primary RQs to be answered:
1. Which are the most energy-efficient machine learning
frameworks?---Here we investigate the overall
energy performance of the selected ML framework by examining
the following steps:
	* Performance implications of the Training
	* Performance implications of the Prediction

TS: Do you want to pick one task out of the selected tasks (3?) for this RQ? Or, all the tasks can be considered here (in that case, we dont need the third RQ - task specific performance).
SG: About the 3rd I was thinking that it can be interesting to find out which framework perform better for a task and find out why. But on a second thought, we can do also such an analysis
in the RQ 1. and 2., no?

2. Which are the most run-time performance-efficient machine learning
frameworks?---Similarly to the above, we investigate the overall
run-time performance of the selected ML framework by examining
the following steps:
	* Performance implications of the Training
	* Performance implications of the Prediction

3. What are the energy, run-time performance, and accuracy
trade-offs of the examined ML frameworks?---Here we are going
to investigate what are each of the frameworks performance
trade-offs with respect to the energy, run-time performance,
and accuracy. Here we could also present a ranking
so that developers could select among frameworks or algorithms
to develop a task whenever energy, run-time performance,
or accuracy is of high demand.

* Which machine learning algorithms are more energy
and run-time performance-efficient for the selected tasks?---Here
we try to find out which ML algorithms, among the selected
ML frameworks, perform better for particular tasks.

Secondary RQs in case we have time:
* How much can the hyperparameter tuning affect the energy
and run-time performance of the correspondning
Machine Learning Frameworks?---Here we are going
to examine a number of tunable hyperparameters to find their
energy and run-time performance implications.


# Copmuter Platform

The actual hardware is not the Stereo but a new machine that is far stronger.
Panos informed me that they are still expecting the motherboard to come.


# Frameworks

Here we can set a number of selection criteria
such as the following:

* Open Source (All four)
* Activity (last commit no more than a year) (All four)
* Popularity (based on GitHub stars)
* Evaluation (evaluated in related work [6]--[9]) 
* Documentation (All four)
* Working toy tutorial (All four)
* Evaluation on the same data (data used in one framework are applicable to all the other frameworks)
* General tasks (select frameworks that can implement different tasks and not specific) (All four)

To collect our candidates, we first used a script found in the [TopDeepLearning repository](https://github.com/aymericdamien/TopDeepLearning).
The corresponding repository offers a Python script that performs a search on GitHub repository Titles and Project descriptions
fields to obtain and rank the repositories with the most GitHub stars based on a number of keywords.
We modified the corresponding Python script's keyworks because some popular ML frameworks
were missing from the results.
After executing the script, we ended with the following list of [repositories](methods/top_ml_frameworks_initial.md) (executing 2020-10-18)
From the initial list, we first excluded repositories that were related to learning courses, papers, etc.
and we ended up with the following [list](methods/top_ml_frameworks_remove_unrelated.md).

Top GitHub frameworks for Machine Learning based on stars:
* Tensorflow
* PyTorch
* Scikit-learn (Although we may use it for deep learning, may forums do not suggest it as it is not supporting GPU usage)
* Caffe

TS: One concern here is that not all framework/libraries support all kinds of tasks. for example, opencv is a vision library; hence tasks other than image/vision might not be feasible.
Two alternatives to mitigate this: 1) choose only generic frameworks 2) task specific frameworks.

SG: I think both of your above points are interesting to examine. However, I think not many people will choose to implement specific task
with specific framework in order to gain more energy savings, but instead they will choose a single framework that is overall more efficient.
So I think we should stick with the (1) and choose more generic frameworks.


# Tasks
There is a really nice and diverse [data-set](https://github.com/tensorflow/datasets) for research purposes
available under the Tensorflow repository [5].
Since it has many tasks for each of the selected categories, we may consider
selecting 1 from each, but which? :P

TS: Potential candidates:

	* NLP-based - [IMDB reviews sentiment analysis](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/imdb_reviews) or [Text summarization](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/multi_news)
	* [image classification](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/cifar10),
 	* [regression](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/forest_fires)
        * defect prediction data-set ([PROMISE](http://promise.site.uottawa.ca/SERepository/datasets-page.html), [NASA](https://github.com/klainfo/NASADefectDataset))
 
MK: We need to find tasks that are already implemented (and are open source software).
Then, we need to write these tasks into other frameworks.
Let's focus on Python-based frameworks as a starting point.
IMHO, it would be interesting to look at NLP tasks.

TS: Agree with MK

MK: Other benchmarks that could be useful for NNs are CIFAR-10 (also mentioned by TS), CIFAR-100, and MNIST.

SG: I have already found some implementations of the above DNN architectures. I am running some tests on Stereo, but I believe we can find most of the on GitHub.


# Algorithms
There are two categories of machine learning algorithms
we can test: (1) standard machine learning algorithms (e.g., linear regression, naive bayes, k-means)
and (2) deep learning algoriths (e.g., Feedforward Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks).
First, we will focus on deep learning algorithms and if we have more time (or maybe extend it for a journal)
then we can use standard machine learning algorithms.
To select the popular deep learning algorithms for each task,
we first collected all the machine learning paper published in ICSE starting from 2020.
Then, we classify for each task the used deep learning algorithms.
The online sheet `algorithm_from_icse` to see the most popular deep learning algorithms
for each task we defined in the previous section.


# Goal

* Find the popular deep learning algorithms for each task
* Implemented tasks use the above algorithms with Tensorflow and Pytorch
* Created script to execute tasks and collect measurements
* Analyze results
* Start with paper writing
