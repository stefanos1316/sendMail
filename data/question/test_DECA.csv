 - most of the time AOT compilation is not desirable
 - ns-level forms are executed during AOT compilation, which is confusing
 - the only reason why most people use AOT is to set the entry point for the uberjar so that you can `java -jar uberjar.jar` instead of the - often superior - `java -cp uberjar.jar -m foo.main`; The whole situation confuses people:
 
 - people don't understand how gen-class works or why it's necessary
 - leiningen warns and unnecessarily suggests that you should set `:aot :all` - which doesn't seem like a good default to me
 - if you specify `:aot [foo.main]` explicitly, that works but due to a bug in lein it compiles the ns twice if you also set `:main foo.main` <https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/issues/2521>; Really all you want is to generate a class that does the equivalent of these two lines: <https://github.com/pesterhazy/lein-aot-example/blob/master/src/foo/main.clj#L7-L8>; AIUI most projects will be better off doing that than AOT'ing everything; ... given that the Clojure compiler is very fast, it doesn't blur the line between compile time and run time and other issues with AOT'ing; Is there something I'm missing here?",0,0,"Solution Proposal, Problem Discovery"

Mr.Harold is a well known scientist living on a planet in Alpha Centauri. He came up with a theory that the principle of uncertainity can be reciprocated as follows,
 
 Value Some function tx(di, V) is always greater than the inverse of planks constant where di is collection of diameters of the size of atoms inside a object in space moving with velocity V. tx(di, V) is equal to the sum of all gx(di[i]) functions values modulo V, where di[i] (diameter of ith atom) is a prime integer.
 
 Note: Velocity is always a prime integer.
 
 gx(x) = {
 1 , if x = 1
 2 , if x = 2
 gx(x-1) + gx(x-2), otherwise
 }
 
 Note: Diameter of all atoms are given in order of fermi-meters
 
 Can you help Mr.Harold to design an efficient algorithm for calculating the value the function tx() ?
