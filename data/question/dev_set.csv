401,Benton,"What is it that ""requires virtualenv"", most things I know don't require anything other than an interpreter and dependencies",0
401,Guillermo,Benton: zappa …. at least if you don’t want to mess with the zappa-conda fork.,0
401,Agueda,i don’t see why you couldn’t use a virtualenv for virtualenv things and conda for conda things. the issue is when you try to mix them together but as long as you’re pointed at the right python interpreter things should work.,0
401,Agueda,what have you tried so far?,0
401,Guillermo,Ok. So … I’m not sure how to ‘point’ it at the right thing … not even sure where to start.,0
401,Guillermo,Just switch the path/env settings?,0
401,Agueda,with virtualenv you activate the environment and it does a lot of handy little things for you like setting the python python.,0
401,Agueda,so you activate the virtualenv when you want to use zappa.,0
401,Agueda,`source /venv-name/bin/activate` should do it,0
401,Agueda,are you using python 2 or python 3?,0
401,Ehtel,"Conda does the same really, so ```conda create envname``` gives you a conda environment",0
401,Ehtel,and then ```source activate envname``` sets it up,0
401,Ehtel,you can use ```which python``` to check which one you are using,0
401,Agueda,"Ehtel: but i think the issue is with the library , :re <https://pythondev.slack.com/archives/C07EFMZ1N/p1497625527626658>",0
401,Guillermo,3 … and (maybe this is just a dumb question) but I was worried that installing using conda to install virtual env is not what I wanted.,0
401,Ehtel,"Agueda: but as said, probably best to not try and mix them up",0
401,Ehtel,"Oh, hadn't seen zappa before",0
401,Agueda,when you do `which python` what comes up?,0
401,Guillermo,Normally the conda one.,0
401,Agueda,"that’s where we would run into our first issue. we wouldn’t want to be using the conda one. we would want something like the system python, i believe.",0
401,Guillermo,Right… thus my question :slightly_smiling_face:,0
401,Guillermo,Seems like I need to be able to deactivate conda and ‘activate’ python3 (sytem would be python2) and then use virtual env. Thanks for getting me started on the right track.,0
401,Ehtel,"when you create the environment, you can specify something like: ``` virtualenv envname --python='path/to/python'```",0
401,Ehtel,if that helps,0
401,Guillermo,"Ehtel: Yes, thanks",0
401,Ehtel,Agueda: then follow advice on activating,0
401,Guillermo,conda sets the path to point to its bin directory … so I may need a way to not do that when trying to do virtualenv/zapp stuff … before I can activate the zappa env (if I understand this correctly).,0
401,Ehtel,related to this? <https://github.com/Miserlou/Zappa/issues/167>,0
401,Guillermo,Yes. I just wanted to explore Zappa without having any conda/virtualenv issues. Don’t need conda for this so wanted to switch to using virtualenv and wasn’t sure how to do it. I think I have a strategy now. Thanks everyone.,0

402,Agueda,Thu: sup,0
402,Agueda,how’s the masters program going?,0
402,Thu,oh I am done,0

402,Agueda,haha.. cool :thumbsup:,0
402,Thu,anything on your end,0
402,Agueda,same old stuff for the most part. i’m just trying to achieve perfect work/life ~balance~ harmony. lol,0
402,Thu,me to,0
402,Thu,I am like 75% coding,0
402,Thu,if not 10 % of no coding is spent thinking of coding,0
402,Thu,the rest is sleep,0
402,Thu,and some netlfix,0
402,Thu,75% of coding is doing work coding,0
402,Agueda,that’s good.,0
402,Thu,I should say 50% coding 15 % work none coding,0
402,Agueda,python or .net?,0

402,Thu,powershell and c#,0
402,Agueda,cool,0
402,Thu,vb hell no,0
402,Agueda,lol,0
402,Agueda,i agree there. i tried to do iron python LONG time ago. i was a dba but the dev was a C# guy and he was said to have been the best in the university. the university was doing consolidation at the system level so he applied to work at our little lab basically to hide.,0
402,Agueda,i tried to take the opportunity to learn what i could but he ended up not being able to do much coding.,0
402,Thu,anyone who uses macs,0
402,Thu,this is good <https://monodraw.helftone.com/>,0

402,Krissy,Wait a second.,0
402,Krissy,So you *were* snooping on our private conversation? :flushed:,0
402,Joana,Laura: I don't know what conversation but I can make say what I want,0
402,Krissy,"Oh, alright. So you can't see our convo?",0
402,Krissy,Alright.,0
402,Krissy,Not that I say anything bad.,0
402,Joana,"Laura: Laura: if is in a channel (public or private) we could snoop with the logs. In private messages doesn't see them, only when you use `/` commands",0
402,Benton,We should probably put that in the intro doc just so we are fully transparent. I think we spoke about that before and filed an issue already,0
402,Joana,slackline is also listening to stuff but only on general,0
403,Deedra,hey guys,0
403,Krissy,hey buddy,0
403,Deedra,"I have installed a python package with pip, made some changes on the source code, recompiled it with `python -m compileall .` but when I run package_name -arguments my changes weren't applied",0
403,Deedra,any tips?,0
403,Krissy,compileall?,0
403,Deedra,yeah I did this at `/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/mypackage`,0
403,Krissy,oh,0
403,Deedra,I also removed the previous .pyc file,0
403,Deedra,before recompiling,0
403,Deedra,"apologies if I'm asking in the wrong channel, I didn't find one for pip issues",0
403,Agueda,help is a good channel to ask in n/w.,0
403,Agueda,did you install your package with `-e`?,0
403,Agueda,"`pip install -e ""path/to/package""`",0
403,Deedra,Agueda: no,0
403,Deedra,just `pip install mypackage`,0
403,Agueda,that would be your issue,0
403,Agueda,#NAME?,0
403,Agueda,it creates symlinks to where your package exists to the site-packages dir so that you can edit the files and see the changes.,0
403,Deedra,hmm,0
403,Deedra,so I need to reinstall it,0
403,Agueda,you can install it again on top (i think).,0
403,Agueda,but it’s probably safer to uninstall first,0
403,Deedra,okay,0
403,Deedra,"`mypackage should either be a path to a local project or a VCS url beginning with svn+, git+, hg+, or bzr+`",0
403,Agueda,is it local?,0
403,Deedra,no,0
403,Agueda,hmmm.. this package is on pypi?,0
403,Agueda,you’re going to want a local copy of whatever package this is. if you are editing it and expecting to see the changes.,0
403,Agueda,for example lets say this is my project dir. ``` |--- requests |--- my_awesome_app ```,0
403,Agueda,these are two python packages. requests has been cloned down from github but i would like to edit it separately and see the changes in `my_awesome_app`,0
403,Agueda,i would go into the `my_awesome_app` dir and activate the virtualenv.,0
403,Agueda,"then type `pip install -e ""../requests""`",0
403,Deedra,virtualenv?,0
403,Deedra,uuuh let me see if I can figure something out by cloning the repo,0
403,Agueda,"yes, a virtualenv is short for “virtual environment” it basically makes a copy of your python binaries and places them in a separate location (again using symlinks). This separate location acts as an isolated environment in which you install dependencies/packages. What you gain from this is the ability to only have the packages and package versions you need for that particular project.",0
403,Agueda,if you are using python3 it comes with virtualenv capabillity,0
403,Deedra,does `pip install` look for any particular file?,0
403,Agueda,pip install will be looking for a `setup.py` file in the root of the package.,0
403,Deedra,great,0
403,Deedra,I think I got this,0
403,Agueda,:thumbsup:,0
403,Agueda,"it takes a bit to get used to. virtualenvs, pip, and so forth but once you get the process down it will be second nature.",0
403,Agueda,and once you start working with multiple projects with different requirements/dependencies and even python versions you’ll see why this extra stuff exists.,0
403,Deedra,hey it worked!,0
403,Agueda,the important thing is to try and start using these practices early on so that they become habit as they are typically used by python developers.,0
403,Deedra,it actually really works!,0
403,Deedra,this is going to be my first pull request,0
403,Deedra,Agueda: thank you so much,0
403,Agueda,that’s fantastic. i’m glad i could help.,0

404,Krissy,"(compression is freeing space, right?)",0
404,Benton,"Depends on what OS, but on mac there is a diskutility thing that is used to erase free space, I have seen that reclaim a bit. Also cleaning up a docker cache, if you use docker",0
405,Isreal,I want to use setattr inside a class’s init method. Should I use it on `self` or `self.__dict__` ?,1
405,Krissy,"Isreal: ``` &gt;&gt;&gt; class A: ... def __init__(self): ... setattr(self, 'a', 5) ... &gt;&gt;&gt; a = A() &gt;&gt;&gt; vars(a) {'a': 5} &gt;&gt;&gt; ```",0

406,Yesenia,"Hey guys for my django web app I'm trying to figure out why my page went from working to a page not found error. It's saying: Page not found (404) Request Method: GET Request URL: .... Using the URLconf defined in EMC_site.urls, Django tried these URL patterns, in this order: $queue_system/ $admin/ The empty path didn't match any of these. You're seeing this error because you have DEBUG = True in your Django settings file. Change that to False, and Django will display a standard 404 page. but it WAS JUST WORKING. I didn't change any code just came home from school. I found that the interpreter was no longer set to python 3.6, it wasn't set to anything so I'm wondering if other things may have changed? Thanks for any help! I'm hoping it is a commonly known problem if something is just working and then starts to give you this error if you come one and off wifi or something. Another one of my projects happens to be having the same problem. I also tried typing /admin or /queue_system after the web address too. Neither worked.",0
406,Edelmira,Yesenia: are you running it in a virtual env?,0
407,Anabel,Can you edit an active/open excel doc in python?,0
407,Jae,whats the use case?,0
407,Jae,"you could, but changes wouldn't be replicated",0
407,Jae,and trying to keep changes in sync between the excel program and the python program would be a headache,0
407,Jae,"so, I'd say this is something that you could do in theory, but I'd not bother",0
407,Anabel,"Yea, I have a client who wants to add rows to a work sheet as he makes selections and I assume he'd like the worksheet open to see the changes. I told him I could just do it in vba but he'd rather have a separate:face_with_rolling_eyes: program apparently.",0
407,Anabel,"How would I go about it, if he insists?",0
407,Anabel,I thought you'd run into the same issue as having a workbook open by two different people at the same time,0
407,Chia,"Anabel: , I think it’s possible with A LOT of work. I don’t know if there are libraries in Python that actually allow you to open and edit without saving a new version. You can copy an existing workbook, make changes and save that one over the old one.",0
407,Jae,google docs :slightly_smiling_face:,0
407,Chia,"Jae: , my thoughts exactly",0
407,Jae,or office 365,0
407,Jae,those already have collaboration built into them,0
407,Jae,why re-invent the wheel,0
407,Jae,and end up handing the client a 10K bill for development time,0
407,Chia,haha,0
407,Chia,"Anabel: , if you’re still keen ~to~ on trying, the best library i’ve seen so far for pretty formatting/excel writing is <http://xlsxwriter.readthedocs.io/>",0
407,Krissy,"Actually, I remember pywin32 can do stuff with Excel documents.",0
407,Krissy,And bonus: you *can* access already opened documents,0
407,Krissy,But that's crazy of course.,0
407,Anabel,"Yea, I've worked with excel before, but never on an open document.",0
407,Edelmira,Anabel: I have done something similar by feeding the worksheet live data and cells update automatically as new data comes in. But I used excel dev tools. I dont think one can edit an open excel sheet otherwise.,0
407,Mirella,yeah the only real live option is to write some awful VBA glue in the excel to speak to something external via python,0
407,Mirella,it's my eternal hope that they at least put in some sort of c# or powershell automation into excel at some point but I've been hoping for like 10 years now :(,0
407,Chia,"Jae: yep, agreed. I mentioned open and edit wasn’t possible in my first comment (at least with the popular python excel libs).",0
408,Adelaida,"hi folks, i got trouble while trying pandas, how to slice a dataframe using Int64Index? I’m search an index base on value ```id = df.loc[df['time'] ==1496587067]``` Then I got an `Index` object `id`, I want to get 10 elms before that index. Which way I should go?",0
408,Jeana,"Adelaida: Hi. How about this snippet: ``` import pandas as pd l_num = [num for num in range(10)] df = pd.DataFrame({ 'num': l_num }, columns=['num']) l_id = df.loc[df['num'] == 5] first_match_id = l_id.index.get_values()[0] print(df[first_match_id - 5:first_match_id]) ```",0
408,Adelaida,"Thanks, I thought there will be a shorter way rather than get the Int index, and slice it with int type :slightly_smiling_face:",0
408,Jeana,Base on your conditional. It may has many matches id. So i think this maybe the shortest way :slightly_smiling_face:.,0
409,Natalia,how do I get an elastic IP to my ec2 instance? the instance is already running and when I click on it’s description. It’s empty,0
410,Hertha,"before a user account can be created in my app it checks whether someone with the same username exists, and then whether someone with the same email has already registered, as both of these are supposed to be unique. Do I really need to check these individually? I know the insert query will fail if the values aren't unique since the columns are set to `unique`, but is there a way to know _which_ one caused the error, so that for example I can tell the user whether their username is taken or whether their email address is already registered.",0
410,Kandra,Hertha: your DB will throw an Integrity error with the name of the field in the message. So you can probably parse that one to find out. It could be easier if you are using some ORM but I am not sure.,0
411,Paulene,"Regarding Python Classes. How do we create classes (along with inheritance) to be able to do something like, Class().Function(data).toJSON toJSON being a @property function. So really I'm looking to take the return of Class().Function(data) and pass it to the toJSON property to format the data. Anyone have an idea?",0
411,Mirella,Paulene: did you mean like chaining methods?,0
411,Paulene,Yes.,0
411,Paulene,I've looked into @property methods @staticmethods,0
411,Paulene,Just can't figure it out,0
411,Mirella,`@staticmethod` just means a function doesn't require an instance of itself to operate on,0
411,Mirella,the key to chaining methods is that you have to return a copy of `self` on chainable methods,0
411,Paulene,What do you mean,0
411,Mirella,"``` class Foo: def __init__(self): self.data = [] # whatever your initial data here would be return self def Function(self, data): self.data = do_thing_with_data(data) return self def toJSON(self): return json.dumps(self.data) ```",0
411,Mirella,something like that would have basic chainable class init and `Function` methods,0
411,Paulene,"like just the fuction needs something like this? ''' class CLASS(object): _x = None def __init__(self): pass def something_to_do(self, var1, var2): x = var1 + var2 return x @property def toFloat(self): return float(_x) '''",0

411,Paulene,Awesome!,0
411,Paulene,I didn't try that ... why didn't I try that?,0
411,Paulene,"Hmm this didn't work. ```class CLASS(object): _x = None def __init__(self): pass def something_to_do(self, var1, var2): x = var1 + var2 return x @property def toFloat(self): return float(_x) print(CLASS().something_to_do(1,2).toFloat)```",0

411,Mirella,your `return x` needs to be `return self`,0
411,Mirella,"because `return x` is just returning the result of `var1 + var2`, which is just an int",0

415,Krissy,that's crazy!,0

419,Steven,"Can anyone explain why this works? ``` with open(path, 'rb') as file_: for chunk in iter(lambda: file_.read(4096), b""""): hash_obj.update(chunk) ``` Specifically the `b""""`?",0
419,Benton,"Steven: the docs for `iter` explain it pretty well (<https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#iter>). The second argument is a ""sentinel"" value, which will create the stop condition when the result of the callable (the lambda function) equals that value",0
419,Benton,"So each iteration it will check the result of the lambda against that value, if they're equal it raises `StopIteration`, a special built in exception to exit a loop.",0
419,Alisha,"Benton: I handle exceptions in the real code, they are included in the ""do some stuff, execute the actual test"" comment. In any event, I thought it made sense to execute the tests this way, and I have a Jenkins job that that does so by executing main.py (each test case being called from within the main file). Really I'm just curious if that goes against any conventions or industry practices because I want to correct any bad habits. I don't really have a reason for rolling my own framework other than to get better at coding (this is my first coding job).",0
419,Benton,"I'd say that, from experience, don't ever roll your own at work. That's free time stuff until you find a deficiency in community accepted frameworks (unittest or pytest, in the python world for the big couple). Every time I have rolled my own it has bitten me hard.",0
419,Benton,"Marisela: - the `illegal byte sequence` is from stderr of the subprocess, one of the pipes is getting something it can't handle. From the try local it's the `cut -c30`.",0
419,Benton,"If you know you don't want whatever is from that, you can just use `stderr=subprocess.PIPE` and it will be captured (and not printed to the python console). Since from the console you will get bytes back, you'll need to decode and probably strip them",0

426,Silas,ive tried running it from both /var/www/shinra/ and var/www/shinra/shinra,0
426,Silas,I ran it with uwsgi and gunicorn both and was able to get them both to serve the app (without the static files) but I was never able to configure either apache or nginx correctly for my EC2 instance,0

428,Jae,"and if you're not doing so, use `create-react-app` to get a good project boilerplate with a very high quality webpack configuration",0
428,Jae,"so, what happens is when you wire up `axios` in your react app, it creates a request to the server via GET, PUT, POST, etc",0

428,Lilla,ok,0
428,Jae,have you done anything like this before?,0
428,Lilla,no thats why im kind of confused,0
428,Lilla,ive been able to feed data into my react components,0
428,Lilla,but now posting to the django setup,0
428,Lilla,its not so clear in my mind,0
428,Lilla,im going through the DRF tutorial,0
428,Lilla,"dos my axios post request need to point to a view URL that takes in a post, grabs what i send and stores?",0
428,Jae,correct,0
428,Jae,"and if you're using DRF, the URL is mapped to at least an `APIView` implementation",0

428,Lilla,yeh perhaps client sided,0
428,Lilla,sending the post request to the DRF API,0
428,Jae,ah ok,0
428,Lilla,processing it,0
428,Jae,<https://daveceddia.com/ajax-requests-in-react/>,0
428,Jae,so that would help client side,0
428,Jae,"server side, really depends on _what_ data you're sending",0
428,Jae,and whether you need to seiralize it to a model instance,0
428,Lilla,yeh i would i'll be sending json to the database,0
428,Lilla,thanks for the help though,0
428,Lilla,it confirms im heading in the right direction with DRF,0
428,Jae,yeah,0
428,Jae,and what makes things easy is it can handle the serialization/deserialization for you,0
428,Jae,so you can send in a model representation via json from your client,0
428,Jae,and it will deserialize it to a model instance which you can do more stuff with,0
428,Jae,"and then sending data back out to the client, it will serialize models to JSON",0
428,Lilla,"ok nice, and just ajax post to the url view which receives the data",0
428,Jae,correct,0

429,Reynaldo,I like that.,0
429,Benton,"Redis-lite would be if you kept celery to make it easier to distribute, otherwise APScheduler could call manage.py commands in your app and be deadsimple",0

429,Reynaldo,Can you fire off tasks immediately without scheduling them using apscheduler?,0
429,Benton,Yeah I think the decorator returns the original function. So you could just call it directly iirc,0

430,Cassie,"hello everyone, I've requirement where dataset is large like 10 millions records, i want to use django rest framework in order to provide that data. Question : which one is the best ORM which is efficient for large datasets? 1. Django ORM 2. SQL alchemy",1
430,Cesar,SQLalchemy is more performant especially if you're using Core.,0
430,Cassie,Cesar: thanks for the suggestion. I've those data on microsoft SQL server.,0
430,Cassie,would like to move to postgresql.,0
430,Jae,"yeah, will be cheaper in the long run",0
430,Jae,no sql server license :slightly_smiling_face:,0
430,Cesar,Cassie: <http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/faq/performance.html>,0
430,Cassie,how about django ORM? Not good from performance point of view?,0
430,Agueda,if you use sqlalchemy you can reflect your mssql database and then create its exact schema in postgres.,0
430,Agueda,and you could use sqlacodegen to create the models.,0
430,Agueda,i've done this very thing to move a .net application to python.,0
430,Makeda,"I think ""performance on large data sets"" and ""ORM"" are mutually exclusive. ORMs exist for development convenience, not high performance.",0
430,Jae,^,0
430,Jae,"and furthermore, you should use pagination and such to actually retrieve the data",0
430,Makeda,"That's not to say you _can't_ get good performance - you can, if you know the ORM well and/or you have access to low level commands like SQLAlchemy Core",0
430,Cassie,Ultimate plan is this only. Move web API .Net to django API.,0
430,Makeda,"But they're not designed for that purpose, and will probably impede you somewhat",0
430,Jae,and there are times you will have to write and execute raw sql,0
430,Agueda,sqlalchemy's orm does a pretty good job in general.,0
430,Makeda,"It depends a lot on the nature of the querying. If you have good indexing set up and you're only working with a few records at a time, the ORM usually doesn't care if there are 10, 10000, or 1000000 rows in a DB",0
430,Makeda,"But if you're doing ""big data"" stuff where you routinely hit large amounts of the table... that's a different matter",0
430,Chia,reducing joins helps a lot too,0
430,Makeda,"yup, ORM joins are often nowhere near as efficient as raw SQL joins",0
430,Jae,one thing I like about django is you can print out the sql query for a given db access,0
430,Jae,and then look at it to see if you can improve it,0
430,Krissy,SQLAlchemy can do this too!,0
430,Jae,"by django, I mean the django framework, not the ORM",0
430,Jae,"since it is possible to replace the default ORM with sqlalchemy (though I've never done this), but the API is largely the same",0
430,Agueda,"yea, you can mix sqlalchemy and django orm. it's all just python at the end of the day. however, if you swap out one for the other you lose all the benefits of the django orm and how it integrates with the framework.",0
430,Cesar,If performance is a factor than use SQLAlchemy core to work on this large data set. If deadlines are more of a factor that use Django ORM since you're already use DRF. Just make sure to use eager loading on relationships where you can to optimize queries. <http://ses4j.github.io/2015/11/23/optimizing-slow-django-rest-framework-performance/>,0

432,Benton,``` `code` ```,0
432,Reynaldo,That was unnecessarily hard :stuck_out_tongue:,0
432,Benton,That's also invalid python you posted - so already it suggests that you aren't really showing what you have tried :confused:,0
432,Jae,makes it easier to format code for readability compared to regular text,0
432,Jae,"so, `datetime.date` requires three inputs",0
432,Jae,"`year`, `month`, `day`",0
432,Jae,all have to be integers,0
432,Jae,"eg, `datetime.date(2017, 05, 17)`",0

432,Dianne,Agueda: poo poo head... them's is fightin' words ...,0
432,Agueda,Dianna: there are ways to format datetimes. depending on what you are using to query the database some of this can be done for you. we don't really know if questions aren't posted with example code that replicates what you are trying to do or code that shows what you have tried.,0
432,Agueda,"hence, the reason you are being directed to a SO guide.",0

432,Agueda,"no, never heard of dreamfactory.",0
432,Kiyoko,Wanda: lol,0
432,Agueda,sounds pleasant.,0
432,Agueda,you can fire off stored procedures with sqlalchemy.,0

432,Wanda,"Well, learning how to do deal with it is fun, and the documentation is lacking and somewhat outdated.",0
432,Agueda,mummification,0
432,Benton,"That's a dangerous proposition. I don't care about the language, the issue is leaking a database and relations to an API. It's good to try to have some separation of the view layer and the persistence layer",0
432,Wanda,It is nice not having to deal with mysql library deficiencies and install issues. Also makes it easier to protect a database.,0
432,Wanda,"We're using stored procedure calls through the rest api, so very little is exposed to the user, and it's per key for access.",0
432,Agueda,i'm mostly just joking around. sorry i can't be more help.,0
432,Wanda,Just hoping I don't have to call my stored procedure once per row to insert... it's going to be hundreds of thousands of rows.,0
432,Kiyoko,Are you locked into DreamFactory?,0
432,Benton,"That is good to hear, though sprocs scare me for other reasons :joy: . Bad flashbacks",0
432,Wanda,No. We've been using it for a few months though.,0
432,Kiyoko,"Had never heard of it before, looking through their site, looks solid. Last couple of API's I did were w/ Slim (PHP framework). Sorry, can't help.",0

433,Jae,Wanda: just me being facetious,0
433,Wanda,"oh, okay.",0
433,Jae,"Chia: not here, sorry",0
433,Joaquina,Chia: yes - what kinds of requests,0
433,Chia,"endpoints related to advertising campaigns! /campaigns, /adsets, /ads",0
433,Joaquina,Ah I dealt more so with querying and pulling info on pages,0
433,Joaquina,but what kind of stuff are you wondering about?,0
433,Chia,efficient ways to grab several thousand records/json arrays,0
433,Joaquina,u can use python with just requests and json thats what I always use,0
433,Joaquina,actually just with requests even,0
433,Joaquina,"`requests.get('url').json()` you just want to look at their documentation and dig a little to find out how you can make the most requests possible - because some of their apis do allow batching, or multiple queries at one time",0
434,Kerstin,hey what is the best way to write a list of json objects to a file,1
434,Kerstin,I was thinking of writing it into a csv,0
434,Kerstin,where each row is a basically a json object or should I save it as a json file?,0
434,Benton,"Kerstin: You should probably either do a CSV, which would mean breaking the JSON into columns in your CSV or just a file where each line is a new JSON object",0
434,Benton,"You could make the JSON a column of the CSV, technically, but that would be kind of awkward to use again",0
434,Kerstin,yeah that is very awkward and hard to use I am thinking of latter,0
434,Benton,Are you going to want to search them for anything? If so - you may be best served to dump the contents into a database so you can query and such,0
434,Kerstin,yeah right now I just want to work with files and if needed we can move to db,0
434,Joaquina,how big is the file,0
434,Kerstin,its quite small 1200x250x4 float array is basically what it is,0
434,Joaquina,dump it as json then either transfor in refine in a matter of seconds or drop it on here if its small enough: <https://konklone.io/json/>,0
434,Kerstin,oh it is better if I automate it I just dumped as a json object,0
434,Kerstin,thanks guys!,0
435,Kerstin,"hey guys I have a quick question ``` dict = {....} keys = dict.keys() values = dict.values() dict2 = dict(zip(keys,values) ``` will dict and dict2 be the same always?",0
435,Kirstie,"since dictionaries are unordered, I would suspect the output of zip to produce the same results as the original dict, barring mutation of keys or values",0
435,Kirstie,this is my best guess,0
435,Kirstie,contents and keys i'm confident in,0
435,Kirstie,"ordering, not sure but think they probably will be the same",0
435,Kirstie,I assume that shallow copy or deep copy is not related to your problem,0
435,Kirstie,"if uncertain, instead of `dict == dict2` you could ask `all(dict.keys() in dict2)`",0
435,Katharina,"Kirstie: Since dictionaries don't keep order like said, the calls to `keys` and `values` are not guaranteed to be in the same order (though the resulting lists _do_ maintain their order but are not created in order). Because of that, zipping them back together will not be equal (because keys may have new values and order may not be the same). However if you used an `OrderedDict` then keys and values lists will maintain order, so calling `zip` in that instance would result in the same results",0
436,Thersa,"hi, i'm getting TypeError: 'dict' object is not callable when using data = request.json(). any ideas why? thanks in advance!",0
436,Chia,"Thersa: hi , what is `request`?",0
436,Chia,"hrm, I've never used bottle but it looks like `request` is implicit. Is it safe for me to assume you want to convert the request to json?",0
436,Thersa,Chia: yeah,0
436,Benton,Chia: :taco:,0
436,Chia,"Okay, per <https://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/api.html#bottle.BaseRequest.json>, it looks like you can only use that method if the content type header is application/json or application/json-rpc. I'm guessing it's not. You can probably see this if you directly print the `request` object. If you still want to force this to json, you can `import json` then use `json.dumps(request)`.",0

437,Joana,how many button are there on a controller ?,0
437,Zana,"Well say someone has the bare bones, a NES USB controller, you are looking at 4 buttons and D",0
437,Krissy,This is the best I've seen. Navigating through almost 100 keys using left/right is a pain.,0
437,Zana,"True, but the issue there is that it counts on analog. Many users will have USB retro pads like NES and SNES (myself included) which cannot easily move diagonal let alone hold it there. And the NES USB controller has a total of 4 buttons, with only 2 really free to play with, so that makes this perhaps too difficult",0
437,Joana,Can you do long press?,0
437,Zana,I should imagine so yes,0
437,Katharina,Zana: you could offer two interfaces: one with the controller that is a bit slower for input (maybe also detect NES vs SNES for number of buttons to help us SNES controller users) and another that allows for just using a keyboard as well. i tend to keep a spare logitech wireless keyboard connected to my retropie,0

437,Katharina,Zana: :taco:,0
437,Zana,"Katharina: you sound like you have the same setup as me, wireless logitech keyboard and snes usb controller. I think that’s probably the way I’m going to do it. Have it determine whether to use keyboard or on screen and then create an onscreen keyboard if it’s a controller.",0
438,Monty,Question: How do you create a view with python &amp; django,0
438,Cesar,You have return as a parameter.,0

438,Monty,Should it now be a function,0
438,Cesar,Django has great documentation. The one I sent you is about creating views. Normally you have `request` as a parameter for a view function. This will contain information pertinent to that particular request.,0

447,Marisa,"i just found out that the python env that i'm using in anaconda is 32 bit, i'll try with the 64 bit version. it's strange anyway as i was monitoring the amount of ram used and it never went up of more that 200/300 MB on a 16GB ram machine",0
447,Makeda,"It could be that the operation you wanted to perform tried to allocate 2GB or more in one go and failed, meaning you never saw it go from 300MB to an intended 2300MB (or similar)",0
447,Chia,~Can a generator be used here?~,0
447,Marisa,"kylotan, by chance, do you know how to create a 64 bit python anaconda environment?",0
447,Makeda,anaconda offers downloads of each - you'd probably want to uninstall the 32 bit version and install the 64 bit one,0
447,Marisa,"i usually tend to install the 64 bit version the of software i use, is there a way to verify that indeed my anaconda installation is a 64 bit one? running python inside an environment says 32 bit",0

449,Jeana,Hi everyone. Which service or tool for crawling website with javascript? For me i used phantomjs and selenium. But their performance is so poor.,1
449,Heike,I often use `requests` in combination with `BeautifulSoup` (using the `lxml` parser).,0
449,Heike,"However, that's not a JavaScript solution. Sorry!",0
449,Lawanda,Jeana: is this some sort of single page web app?,0
449,Jeana,Kind of. Because some pages need to excute javasript for rendering full content. So i have to find some browser which can excute javascript for making dynamic crawler.,0
449,Jeana,But according to real life experience. I see phantomjs or selenium is so slow,0
449,Jeana,one minute they can only render 5-6 page,0
449,Jeana,Which cannot serve my purpose,0
449,Heike,Maybe spread the workload out to multiple VMs and let each do a part of the URLspace?,0
449,Lawanda,Jeana: can't you just repeat queries that javascript is making and get the data from the backend directly?,0
449,Jeana,Lawanda: Can i make DM with you ?,0
449,Lawanda,Let's keep our conversation public,0
449,Lawanda,I'm not the only one who can help you,0
449,Jeana,Ok. I’m afraid that i will mess our channel. So the problem is i’m making a crawler which can extract the article main content of any news website.,0
449,Jeana,So for making that i have to get the css and javascript for detecting which is article page and navigation page.,0
449,Jeana,My only bottleneck is page rendering tools. For this i used phantomjs and selenium.,0
449,Jeana,But with their pool performances i can’t really use this for production,0
449,Lawanda,"Yeah, you said that a couple of times already.",0
449,Willa,and not the only who need to solve it,0
449,Lawanda,Jeana: have you seen my previous question?,0
449,Jeana,"Yup already. But it can’t help. Some web pages make different requests ajax for rendering full content each page. So if i write some algorithm for detecting those request format and fake it. It will make my issue extremely complex. So for reducing the complex, i used some service which can return me the full content after javascript executing.",0
449,Jeana,Lawanda: and sorry for repeating my issue. I just want to centralize again all of my issue.,0
449,Lawanda,"You still have to parse the returned page, right? Then how parsing different parts is it more complex than rendering everything and parsing parts as a whole?",0
449,Lawanda,"You don't need to write an algorithm to detect requests. You just need to open the page, to look into web inspector and copy-paste related queries from ""Network"" tab",0
449,Lawanda,That's pretty much it,0
449,Jeana,Because I have to find a way to deal with “Any” pages not for specific one as you suggest.,0
449,Lawanda,"You have to find a way to deal with all pages you're interested in, yes. If that's such a huge problem, then your only way is to use selenium/headless chrome/whatever",0
449,Jeana,"Yes, so i want to ask if someone had deal with this problem already.",0
449,Heike,Jeana: Apparently your problem is slowness and lack of processing capacity. Maybe using multiple machines is an option?,0
449,Heike,"I mean, instead of machine 1 processing news sites A, B and C in succession, you start 3 machines, where machine 1 will process news site A, machine 2 news site B and machine 3 news site C. That will give a 3x speedup.",0
449,Jeana,Yes i’ve already done that. But i wonder if there is some tool can do this better than phantomjs either selenium. Right now i used 3 servers but only 200 page/ minute has been rendered. I used cache and proxy and image replacing for reducing the time cost. But it is only slightly better,0
449,Krissy,"sorry to interject, i haven't read everything, but one instance per core (minus 1-2 cores for main process) gives us about 30 headless browsers per machine",0
449,Krissy,on a second-to-largest GCC instance,0
449,Krissy,"also, headless chrome :heart:",0
449,Jeana,I used to open 10 instance of headless browser per machine. But the time cost increases with instance of headless browser. More instance ---&gt; more time for rendering.,0
449,Jeana,I don’t know if i’m doing something wrong with that,0
449,Krissy,how many cores on these machines?,0
449,Jeana,8 cores.,0
449,Krissy,10 is too many then :slightly_smiling_face:,0
449,Jeana,Anywho thanks for your suggestion with headless chrome. I will take a try with it,0
449,Jeana,:slightly_smiling_face:,0
449,Jae,"so, phantom is notorious for being slow, and having problems",0
449,Jae,"not surprising since its been a one-person project for a number of years now. given the challenges of browser development, phantom's state of functionality is impressive with that restriction",0
449,Jae,"however, it is now deprecated and no longer supported since headless chrome came out",0
449,Jae,"and unfortunately, this is an instance of where horizontal scaling will have to be used, where you distribute the tasks to be executed among a cluster of similar instances",0
449,Jae,"just like with celery workers, there's a sweet spot that can be hit with tasks on each machine for optimium efficiency, but that takes alot of experimenting to do.",0
449,Jae,"Jeana: what instance size are you running this on, and what provider? AWS, GCC, Azure?",0
449,Jeana,It’s running on my own server company. Not provided by any companies above.,0
449,Jae,then your only option is to either reduce the rate of crawling or add more hardware,0
449,Jae,because the primary issue is rendering the page and there is a significant lack of options for that,0
449,Jeana,Thanks for your advice Jason.,0
449,Jae,good luck,0

454,Sallie,and where do I add styles? in noscript? - it's not working.,0
454,Makeda,The noscript stuff only runs when there is no script. So I'm guessing that 'loadCSS.min.js' handles all your stylesheets. I'm guessing that's part of some client-side framework you're using,0

454,Latasha,Or is it best to go from the root?,0
454,Makeda,"Opening a file is much the same in most languages - it's relative to the current working directory, which _might_ be the directory that the program lives in, but it can be anything",0

460,Anabel,"It's always going to be &lt;list&gt;, &lt;list&gt;, &lt;list&gt;, &lt;string&gt;",0
460,Anabel,not exactly sure what you mean when you say tokenization steps,0
460,Anabel,Kyle: **,0
460,Kyle,"Anabel: if this is a string, then you can tell that there is a ""],["" motiff that would split it into the logical pieces.",0
460,Kyle,"You just have to examine it, think, and then act.",0
460,Anabel,let me try,0
460,Anabel,"returns `['Create Content', ('Facebook', 'Twitter'), 'Photography', 'One sweet vision']`",0
460,Anabel,I guess I was hoping there was a way to do it more pythonic than this brute force route I took,0

461,Benton,"Can anyone see any major drawbacks of having a simple boolean 'can_write` field on a user object for a very limited scope permissions (literally for the forseeable future: read/only and read/write)?

461,Gillian,"well , it's like the 'is_admin' field ,right?,isn't the best choice,but it's fine , i don't see any drawbacks ""for a very limited scope permissions""",0
461,Benton,I figure that's enough to not lock us in too much if we need more. A simple migration could get us to a more involved permissions model,0
462,Beulah,"Hi guys. There is one site that returns response in string like: `{""ConsignorName"": ""first part ""second part""""}` which should be json. Result should be `{'ConsignorName': 'first part ""second part""'}`. And I can't just `json.loads(data)` because it fails with `json.decoder.JSONDecodeError: Expecting ',' delimiter:...`. So I somehow need to cast this string in dict. Maybe u know some easy fast pythonic way to do this? So far I came up with blunt operations with split and check for double quotes inside double quotes and u can see it's already getting boring and I'm gonna stop right here :sweat:",0
462,Makeda,"It is actually broken JSON, so I'm surprised that it returns it. You can `strip` the { and }, then use `split` on the "":"", and you should have the key and the value",0
462,Beulah,"Ikr, I was like ""how does it even work??"" Someone definetaly needs to reformat their data... :sigh:",0
462,Heike,Probably they're not using a json library to generate that output. I guess they're just concatenating strings and hope for the best.,0
462,Willa,they can replace unicode quotes after converting it into string,0
462,Heike,These people would write `&lt;consignorname&gt;&lt;first&gt;Jan&lt;second&gt;de Vries&lt;/first&gt;&lt;/second&gt;&lt;/consignorname&gt;` if they were to output XML ;-),0
462,Beulah,U know the funny thing? They return xml and inside that xml is a string that should represent json. Like wtf :laughing::sweat_smile:,0
462,Beulah,I'm surprised `requests` can even parse that,0
462,Heike,"I recently scraped an angular website which also did something like that: a response which is a HTML fragment of a page, with a DIV in it that contained JSON.

464,Makeda,How do you define months in this context?,0
464,Sallie,Makeda: sorry?,0
464,Makeda,A month is not a fixed unit of time (at least not in the cultures I know of),0
464,Sallie,I need to know how many months have passed between two dates,0
464,Makeda,If you want the intuitive answer then I think you will just have to check the difference in years and months individually,0
464,Sallie,"for example I started it today - June 2017, and the end - June 2016. The difference - 12 months",0
464,Sallie,I think the best way is to pass the Python...,0
464,Makeda,Does this work? `((endDay.year - startDay.year) * 12) + (endDay.month - startDay.month)`,0
464,Sallie,works,0
464,Sallie,Thank you. You are a genius.,0
464,Makeda,You can't use timedelta for this because a span of 30 days is over a month if the span starts on Feb 1st and under a month if the span starts on Jan 1st,0
464,Makeda,no problem,0
464,Sallie,exactly...,0
464,Cristina,"Wanda: if you self host, there is no limit",0
464,Cristina,I would recommend that. With docker its really not all that hard to host it,0
464,Cristina,"thats what I do. All similar systems will have some type of limit. There is also bugsnag, and rollbar, but they all have limits",0
464,Cristina,"self hosting is the only way to have no limits. Oh, I guess google cloud has one called stack-driver that is just a flat monthly fee + minimal data charges",0
464,Krissy,use `dateutil`,0

464,Makeda,I don't think arrow helps here,0
464,Krissy,"if you don't need to do anything complex, dateutil is nice and small",0
464,Benton,"Just use a unix timestamp and do maths in second offsets :wink: Of course, then there is the problem of leap seconds...",0

464,Cristina,I have a feeling there are some built in's I can use...,0

466,Luetta,Do that outside of my environment?,0

466,Benton,Looks like having a space in there is causing your problems,0

466,Luetta,Hmm,0
466,Benton,rename `Small\ Projects` to `small_projects`,0
466,Luetta,I can move it to my desktop,0
466,Benton,Or create your virtualenv at `~/.virtualenvs/my_project`,0
466,Benton,which is pretty standard,0
466,Luetta,Giving it a go,0
466,Luetta,"Perfect, that worked! Thank you!",0
466,Luetta,What does adding this (`~/.virtualenvs/my_project`) at the end of the virtual environment actually do?,0
466,Benton,"It sets the location, is that what you are asking?",0
466,Benton,`virtualenv -p $(which python3) ~/.virtualenvs/my_project`,0
466,Agueda,it’s the destination of where the virtualenv will be created.,0
466,Benton,So now you need to `source ~/.virtualenvs/my_project/bin/activate` when you need it,0
466,Benton,"I add that to an `autoenv.zsh` script, so each project in my shell auto-sources.",0
466,Benton,If you use `virtualenvwrapper` it's even easier: `mkproject -p $(which python3.6) my_app` and then later you can `workon my_app` and it auto put you in your source :slightly_smiling_face:,0
466,Luetta,Thank you so much guys! I’ve got a lot to learn about virtualenvironments,0
466,Agueda,i use `pyenv` with `pyenv-virtualenv`. both of them together allow you to use a `.python_version` file. The python_version file is kept in the root dir of your project. When you change into the project’s dir it will activate the right virtualenv for you. it’s quite nice although the instructions of getting it going weren’t all too clear. <https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv> <https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv>,0
466,Luetta,Benton: :taco:,0

477,Sunshine,does anyone know of a way to fetch and update a user with a single db trip in django?,0
477,Lawanda,Sunshine: why?,0
477,Sunshine,i'm looking for a way to optimise my db calls,0
477,Sunshine,Lawanda:,0
477,Lawanda,Sunshine: have you profiled your views? Are you sure fetching and updating users is the most expensive operation?,0
477,Sunshine,Lawanda: well for large data sets it sure is . how do you mean 'profiled your views '?,0
477,Lawanda,I mean what makes you think that this is the most expensive operation? Do you _think_ so or you have profiled your code so you _know_ it's the most expensive operation?,0
477,Heike,"Looking up one record in your user table, and updating that record, is really the bottleneck? That sounds quite suprising to me, too.",0
477,Lawanda,"That may be the bottleneck, for sure. Which is likely to be fixed by creating a proper index.",0
477,Joana,anyways in sql you are able to retrieve data from an `update` query,0
477,Sunshine,Lawanda: Heike: won't it be performant to have one db trip to fetch and update rather than have two trips?,0
477,Lawanda,"Sunshine: please, google about premature optimization",0
477,Heike,Your remark smells like premature optimisation,0
477,Lawanda,Ha,0
477,Sunshine,Joana: i like this,0
477,Heike,"Joana: Some DBMSses indeed can, see RETURNING clause in PostgreSQL's UPDATE. <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/sql-update.html>",0
477,Joana,yeah that's what I was referring to,0
477,Heike,...but don't expect such things to work in MySQL or Oracle.,0
477,Heike,I never found the need to return something from an UPDATE (except maybe the nr. of records that were changed) because what I put into the UPDATE I have available in my program anyway.,0
477,Heike,Joana: So I'm curious about for what you want such a feature.,0
477,Joana,we use it from time to time when we need to return ids for some processing (for example),0
477,Krissy,&gt; what I put into the UPDATE I have available in my program anyway Not when there is an SQL function / expression in an UPDATE clause,0
477,Joana,you have available what you put in the update but you might not have all the row,0
477,Joana,if you have read only data for example,0
477,Heike,"Ah ok, I see. That might be handy indeed.",0
477,Krissy,I have to add: I don't think `UPDATE ... RETURNING ...` will increase performance substantially for a typical web app,0
477,Krissy,even the fastest ORM (something like Peewee) is still quite slow,0
477,Joana,if your db is on the network you gain a bit,0
477,Joana,but otherwise not really. It's just a nice to have,0

480,Luetta,"it’s installed for sure, so I don’t know why I can’t import",0
480,Joana,can you do a `pip freeze`,0
480,Joana,or `pip3 freeze`,0
480,Benton,The issue is your `pip3` is from `python 3.6` but your `python3` command is running `python 3.5`,0
480,Benton,"``` # from pip3 install slackclient... Requirement already satisfied: slackclient in /usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages # and from the python3 command Python 3.5.1 (v3.5.1:37a07cee5969, Dec 5 2015, 21:12:44) ```",0

480,Agueda,"what model mac, windows, etc.?",0
480,Luetta,mac!,0
480,Agueda,on a mac i install brew and then install python2 and python3. you definitely don’t want to use system python for anything.,0
480,Agueda,then i use penv to manage python versions and virtualenvs.,0
480,Luetta,ahh ok,0

480,Benton,I'll try to do it over the weekend and it'll be free,0
480,Luetta,Thanks!!,0
480,Agueda,windows you just install python from the msi.,0
480,Agueda,and make sure you check the box to add python to the path.,0
480,Luetta,Yah i’m trying to install virtualenvwrapper,0
480,Luetta,but am getting that,0
480,Luetta,my virtualenvwrapper seems to be here `/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.5/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh`,0
480,Agueda,your going to want to add some lines to your `.bash_profile` or `.bashrc` file.,0
480,Luetta,"it’s different if i’m using zsh, correct?",0
480,Agueda,``` export WORKON_HOME=$HOME/.environments source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh ```,0
480,Agueda,something like that,0
480,Agueda,yea you put it in your zshconfig however you have that setup.,0
480,Agueda,i load my zsh config via my own script that i call at the end of the config zsh uses.,0
480,Agueda,`WORKON_HOME` is the dir where all your virtualenvs are installed when you write the `mkvirutualenv` command,0
480,Katharina,Just the last line should be sufficient,0
480,Agueda,i trimmed it down to those two.,0
480,Katharina,Sorry spotty internet the rest of it popped through haha,0
480,Benton,"yeah, `~/.zshrc`",0
480,Luetta,Done!,0
480,Luetta,got it,0
480,Benton,:thumbsup::skin-tone-4:,0
480,Luetta,so now no need to run this?,0
480,Katharina,I wish more shells had bash compatibility layers like `fish` does,0
480,Agueda,the last two lines you paste into your shell config,0
480,Luetta,yup,0
480,Agueda,you could run them yourself from the command line but that isn’t too efficient to do every time you open a terminal.,0
480,Luetta,ahh ok,0
480,Luetta,thanks!,0
480,Agueda,if you ever use pyenv you will need to do something similar.,0
480,Luetta,"It’s bad practice to use folders with spaces when making the virtual environment, right?",0
480,Agueda,on a mac you can install that with brew. it makes everything super easy.,0
480,Agueda,"dang, want to see how things get dated over time? this is a super simple ansible playbook for installing virtualenvwrapper from a yr ago. <https://gist.github.com/mikefromit/4281f29013fe3b4306a87cb64a2ad1fd>",0
480,Luetta,"virtual environments are extremely cool, but they definitely have a learning curve to them",0
480,Agueda,lots of things have changed in ansible now.,0
480,Agueda,"yea, i was a bit confused by them when i first started.",0
480,Agueda,i was thankful for those few tutorials i found that really went through creating those.,0
480,Luetta,why would i want the virtual environment in the standard environment folder and not in my project folder?,0
480,Agueda,i remember on my first projects i pushed to github i had committed my virtualenv.,0
480,Agueda,lol,0
480,Agueda,when you need to manage python versions.,0
480,Luetta,haha ouch,0
480,Luetta,my first push had my twitter app tokens!,0
480,Agueda,yea that was bad. i’ve never done that but i’ve done some google hacks to look at when ppl did that.,0
480,Luetta,"Haha yah, luckily it was just a monitor i was setting up.",0
480,Agueda,i ran a python script to use a custom google search with a googlehack string and then i had splunk index all the results. since the api only allowed a certain amount of calls for free I ran a cron daily.,0
480,Agueda,i did my due diligence and contacted ppl.,0
480,Katharina,Yeah the main problem with vanilla virtualenv is you end up with folders all over the place and management is a mess,0
480,Katharina,Is pyenv still used a lot?,0
480,Benton,If I don't use virtualenvwrapper I use pipenv or just docker (but local dev with docker on python isn't the best since you still need a local install for code completion,0
480,Katharina,Hmm I get code completion in webstorm doing local docker dev. I mount the volume where the code is,0
480,Benton,"Node uses `node_modules` which is a sibling of the project, python uses `site-packages` which isn't - so my guess is that may be why",0
480,Katharina,Yeah was just realizing that,0
480,Katharina,Unless you do a virtualenv in the root of the project?,0
480,Luetta,Node is fun but callbacks are a headache haha,0
480,Benton,"Yeah, maybe that works - but then why bother with developing in docker?",0
480,Benton,"Luetta: callbacks are getting less and less common , at least! :slightly_smiling_face:",0
480,Katharina,Current LTS of node has promises by default,0

484,Hassie,"Hi, I need a suggestion. I am planning to start a new project for logging user analytics using MongoDB. Which framework will be better to use with Mongo - Flask or Django?",1
484,Agueda,flask,0
484,Agueda,at one point in time around django 1.4 mongo was great with django but then ppl stopped maintaining some core libraries.,0
484,Benton,#ERROR!,0
484,Benton,"Though if you are doing user analytics, you may need something lower latency since that may be a ton of events",0
484,Agueda,i built my recent highlighter with elastic search. it worked really well. I would imagine throwing kibana on there could make for a neat analytics platform.,0
484,Agueda,<https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana>,0
484,Hassie,Agueda: Can you tell me more about it?,0
484,Agueda,i’ve built an elk stack for logging at my old place of employment. it depends on what you mean by analytics :wink:.,0
484,Agueda,you could analyze the data with scripts and use things like stochastic gradient descent and things like that or you can build dashboards.,0
484,Agueda,not sure how you’re trying to check out these events.,0
484,Agueda,we used the logs to determine if there were issues in the network.,0
484,Hassie,"I will log request, pageviews and other user actions.",0
484,Agueda,do you have any experience with flask?,0
484,Agueda,or python web frameworks?,0
484,Agueda,i try not to assume things.,0
484,Hassie,Yes I've decent experience on django,0
484,Agueda,k,0
484,Agueda,just a sec let me bust out a code sample.,0
484,Hassie,I can learn flask fast,0
484,Hassie,pycharm is slow :stuck_out_tongue:,0
484,Agueda,i also had to get my kid off of the table.,0
484,Hassie,okay,0
484,Agueda,for user analytics you could use django or flask. to get the user events you’ll need some sort of middleware. i’m not talking about that part. what i’m showing is how to get data into elastic search.,0
484,Agueda,once you have data in elastic search then the kibana parts comes into play but you will also need to figure that part out.,0
484,Hassie,ok,0
484,Hassie,Waiting :slightly_smiling_face:,0
484,Agueda,"ya, wondering if i should make a big gist. there are several things involved.",0
484,Hassie,ok take your time :slightly_smiling_face:,0
484,Agueda,dang i need to edit this in a bigger window. lol,0
484,Agueda,"either way, in flask you’ll need to do something like that and establish a connection with elastic search.",0
484,Agueda,when your app starts up.,0
484,Agueda,there may be a flask-extension for it already,0
484,Agueda,where you can simply add in the right settings.,0
484,Hassie,ok then,0
484,Agueda,i’ve updated it with the model. you need to create a model to describe how your document is structured.,0
484,Agueda,oh cool. yea you can use this :smiley: <https://github.com/chiangf/Flask-Elasticsearch>,0
484,Hassie,You used Flask + ES + Kibana?,0
484,Agueda,no kibana,0
484,Agueda,in my project recently.,0
484,Agueda,my past project with ES and Kibana didn’t have flask,0
484,Hassie,How did you build dashboard?,0
484,Agueda,i built the dashboard with kibana.,0
484,Agueda,flask is only involved in this process b/c it’s generating the event.,0
484,Agueda,i’m just showing how to save data to elastic search in python with a flask view. once you have data in EL then you can use Kibana to do analytics. Kibana could be installed on a totally different server.,0
484,Agueda,hmm.. i could probably PR this elastic search model code i have with this flask extension.,0
484,Agueda,it’s nice mapping a document to a class.,0
484,Hassie,"Yeah, that will be nice.",0
484,Agueda,i know it’s a lot of pieces there and gaps but you get started down the path you will get each working :wink:.,0
484,Hassie,i've few questions.,0
484,Agueda,k,0
484,Hassie,"Can you tell me about the architecture part, or process flow.",0
484,Hassie,Is it something like this - 1. User creates an event. 2. Flask view logs data in ES. 3. Kibana gets data from ES and shows it in dashboard.,0
484,Hassie,Aren't you using any async tasks queues like rabbitmq or kafka?,0
484,Agueda,you could but in the most basic sense you would use the middleware to do a post on elastic search with the data about the event.,0
484,Hassie,I found this blog post for similar usecase - <http://engineering.hackerearth.com/2015/02/26/logging-millions-requests-what-it-takes/|engineering.hackerearth.com/2015/02/26/logging-millions-requests-what-it-takes/> They used kafka + rabittmq + mongodb + S3 + redshift to build complete architecture,0
484,Hassie,ES will be better than this?,0
484,Agueda,"oh idk about that. i haven’t used all those before. what i proposed was for something simpler but it could grow to using those things once you need “web scale”. hence, the “logging millions of requests everyday”.",0
484,Hassie,"okay, thanks :slightly_smiling_face: Now I should connect the dots using the code you provided.",0
484,Hassie,"One quick question, how many servers u used? What will be minimal cost to setup this?",0
484,Agueda,"yea, i’m thinking i may need to do an example app for this now.",0
484,Agueda,do you already have a site you’re trying to integrate this into?,0
484,Agueda,or your just interested in getting it going on your own site?,0
484,Hassie,I want to integrate it to a website running on Django.,0
484,Agueda,<https://qbox.io/blog/how-to-elasticsearch-python-django-part1>,0
484,Hassie,cost involved?,0
484,Agueda,oh idk the cost we had our own vm infrastructure.,0
484,Hassie,How many VMs you used?,0
484,Agueda,there was a central server that ran logstash and the elastic search server with kibana so 2 servers. we also had another server running OSSEC.,0
484,Agueda,it’s been a few years now. i’ve slept since then and don’t remember all the details as i’m not involved in networking admin anymore.,0
484,Agueda,<https://qbox.io/blog/welcome-to-the-elk-stack-elasticsearch-logstash-kibana>,0
484,Agueda,i remember our biggest problem was storage.,0
484,Agueda,there was also grokking all the different kinds of logs.,0
484,Agueda,the one big gripe about ES is that it’s easy to get data in there but hard to take it back out. to combat this while you save a document for EL to index you can also create a record in a relational db. this will help for other kinds of reporting.,0
484,Agueda,for logs we didn’t care about the relational db part. we needed to analyze them in real-time and then archive them.,0
484,Agueda,you can also get ES running super quick with docker.,0
484,Hassie,Why RDBMS and not MongoDB?,0
484,Agueda,well ES is already a document store. using something like Mongo would be redundant but i guess if you wanted to you could.,0
484,Agueda,it’s generally not a good idea to try and do things a relational database can do in a document database like joins. i suggested saving to a rdbms in the process mainly so you can take advantage of an rdms at the same time. this won’t be needed for every application.,0
484,Agueda,this is my docker-compose.yml for ES: ``` version: '3' services: elasticsearch: image: nickstenning/elasticsearch-icu ports: - '127.0.0.1:9200:9200' ``` you can type `docker-compose up` and it will start the service for you.,0
484,Hassie,"So I should store data in both, ES and RDBMS if I want to access it frequently?",0
484,Agueda,i don’t know what you should do b/c i don’t know the requirements i was just letting you know what you could do :wink:,0
484,Agueda,&gt; i suggested saving to a rdbms in the process mainly so you can take advantage of an rdbms at the same time. this won’t be needed for every application.,0
484,Hassie,"Hmm. By storing document in RDBMS, did you mean creating schema based on keys in document?",0
484,Agueda,"yea, you can save the data to the db and get back from the database the inserted record. That would look like this maybe `{""id"": 1, ""name"": ""a1gupta"", ""role"": ""1"", ""created_on"": ""2017-10-11 343434""}`. once you get what the database has you send it to ES.",0
484,Agueda,that’s how you would make a search engine with ES btw. which is what i did recently. you can take those same values in the dict and pass them as query params to a search endpoint.,0
484,Hassie,Agueda: Thanks . I think I should start now to understand it better. :upside_down_face:,0
484,Agueda,code it the way you see it :smiley: it looks like there may be a few problems to solve before getting to ES like getting the events you want.,0
484,Agueda,i’m sure there are some django plugins that can help you with that.,0
484,Agueda,ppl in the <#C0LMFRMB5|django> channel would know.,0

486,Benton,"In PyCharm, can you have the project run kick off a bunch of things at once? For example, I want to run Django, Celery Workers, and Celery Beat",0

486,Joana,`subprocess.open` at the start of the script ? :smile:,0
486,Benton,"haha, no kidding. I guess if you don't need a bunch of workers you can run beat and the worker: ``` celery -A &lt;your proj&gt; worker --beat -l debug --scheduler django ```",0

486,Benton,I think those block before starting,0

490,Deshawn,this is a pretty basic questions - but when an exception is thrown the rest of the code after where the exception occurred is not executed unless it was handled in a `try` `except`?,0
490,Deshawn,"I'm deciding whether I should test code with a context manager of an object that throws an exception, although I don't think I am correct in the what happens",0
490,Joana,yes. you can add a `finally` if you want a piece of code to always be executed,0
490,Joana,it depends on the what but in some case it can overlapp yes,0
490,Deshawn,"so let's say that's the code and we're expecting a new_object to be created based on the paramteters, but an exception can occur like a URLError or something",0
490,Deshawn,what I'm trying to do is test the correct exception is thrown/handled,0
490,Deshawn,so I was thinking...,0
490,Krissy,`as new_object` looks strange to me,0
490,Joana,If you are testing code I believe both pytest and unitest have special context manager to test errors,0
490,Krissy,just do ``` with self.assertRaises(URLError): new_object = NewObject(param_to_cause_exception) ```,0
490,Deshawn,yah that is unittest,0
490,Krissy,"also, don't test anything else in this function",0
490,Krissy,you're testing only the fact that wrong URL causes an exception,0
490,Joana,in that case if the assert is correct the test will continue as expected,0
490,Deshawn,with the `as new_object` I can pass it through the rest of the code as an exception object which I found here<https://docs.python.org/2/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestCase.assertRaises>,0
490,Joana,Krissy: but make a good point,0
490,Joana,oh ok. You want to test what is in the exception ?,0
490,Deshawn,Krissy: thanks that does make sense,0
490,Deshawn,right,0
490,Deshawn,Joana: and how the rest of the code responds to that if that makes sense,0
490,Joana,both object have the same name that's a little confusing,0
490,Joana,you can interact with the exception after the `with` like any other object. For example to check what's inside,0
490,Deshawn,"right, check error codes and such",0
490,Deshawn,I think I was incorrectly thinking of how the object would be handled if an exception was thrown (not under test),0
490,Deshawn,in my test I am asserting the correct exception is thrown given a bad parameter,0
490,Deshawn,Joana: Krissy: I think I've got it from here thanks guys :taco: :taco:,0

490,Sherie,Best way to order a list based on another list?,0
490,Joana,there is something like `sorted()`,0
490,Joana,and I guess you can pass like a lambda to do custom sort,0
490,Krissy,"``` &gt;&gt;&gt; order = ['b', 'c', 'a'] &gt;&gt;&gt; sorted(['a', 'b', 'c'], key=order.index) ['b', 'c', 'a'] &gt;&gt;&gt; ```",0

491,Joana,this will point `www.my_awesome_website` to the same IP as `c.storage....`,0
491,Joana,no you don't need to put the whole name,0

491,Krissy,Maybe I'm unlucky and DNS take an unusually long time to update?,0
491,Joana,`2a00:1450:4010:c08::80` is the correct IP,0

494,Joana,more like 7 - 13 :stuck_out_tongue:,0
494,Sherie,That too. Or run it every sunday and check if it's between 7 and 14. I think this option will run less unnecessary times. There isn't much load on the system that i'm building so it doesn't matter,0

498,Kacie,Jae: Let me explain it more detailly,0
498,Kacie,"There is a website that I am setting up and i want to grant direct access to persons i a given location that is persons connected to my WiFi. If a person is connected to my WiFi, he can access the website with no problem, but if he is not in my WiFi, he should enter a passcode before proceeding to the site's content",0
498,Jae,why?,0
498,Jae,why do you want to have such a huge hole in your authentication,0
498,Jae,just have them sign in,0
498,Jae,and keep a session cookie active for them,0
498,Jae,"and so when they re-access the site, their login session is still active",0
498,Makeda,"I've seen this sort of thing done before to facilitate company intranets, and that's done primarily just by virtue of listening on an inward-facing network address. But sometimes there is still extra auth anyway, because it's not a great hardship.",0
498,Dane,Is it the case that it’s irrelevant *who* the user is that accesses content? i.e. there is no user data specific to a user?,0
498,Makeda,...also that.,0
498,Dane,"Makeda: if it’s truly irrelevant who people are, then yeah, I’d combine ’s comment with a VPN from the wifi router to the network that second interface is on",0

838,Yung,"I am constructing a nested datastructure, similar to a binary tree, recursively using ``` (defn make-tree [{in :in out :out left :left right :right :as tree} indices] (cond (empty? indices) tree :else (assoc tree :left (make-tree {:in (conj in (first indices)) :out out} (rest indices)) :right (make-tree {:in in :out (conj out (first indices))} (rest indices))))) ```",0
838,Yung,however the recursion will run quite deep and cause stack overflow. Is there a lazy way I can define this tree? I will not actually visit all of the tree,0
838,Yung,"In short it sets up a deeply nested map, but I want to do this in a lazy way so that the values mapped to by keys are not evaluated until accessed",0
838,Argentina,You can do tail recursion for the stack overflow but that won’t help with the lazy part.,0
838,Alda,michaellindon: There’s <https://github.com/Malabarba/lazy-map-clojure>,0
838,Alda,I haven’t tried it myself but it seems to do what you want,0
838,Alda,"otherwise, you’ll have to implement something like that yourself with `delay` and `force`",0
838,Yung,Alda: Hi,0
838,Yung,"I have come up with this, i think it is inelegant",0
838,Yung,``` (defn make-lazy-tree [{in :in out :out left :left right :right :as tree} indices] (cond (empty? indices) tree :else (assoc tree :left (fn [] (make-lazy-tree {:in (conj in (first indices)) :out out} (rest indices))) :right (fn [] (make-lazy-tree {:in in :out (conj out (first indices))} (rest indices)))))) ```,0
838,Yung,"so instead of returning the next subtree it returns a function to the next subtree, which can be called like this",0
838,Yung,``` (defn my-left [t] ((:left t))) (defn my-right [t] ((:right t))) (-&gt; foo my-right my-right my-left) ```,0
838,Yung,"giving: ``` =&gt; {:in #{2}, :out #{0 1}, :left #function[bab.core/make-lazy-tree/fn--20560], :right #function[bab.core/make-lazy-tree/fn--20562]} ```",0
838,Yung,I guess delay is kind of doing the same thing?,0
838,Yung,"just tried it, delay works nicely too",0
838,Miquel,you can’t tail call that code though,0
838,Miquel,not without a radical design shift to move stack data into the heap,0
838,Yung,Alda: agreed. As per s suggestion i wrapped the calls with delay,0
838,Yung,``` (defn make-delay-tree [{in :in out :out left :left right :right :as tree} indices] (cond (empty? indices) tree :else (assoc tree :left (delay (make-delay-tree {:in (conj in (first indices)) :out out} (rest indices))) :right (delay (make-delay-tree {:in in :out (conj out (first indices))} (rest indices)))))) ```,0
838,Yung,writing ``` (defn my-left [t] @(:left t)) (defn my-right [t] @(:right t)) ```,0
838,Yung,"I can traverse the tree to the leaf nodes that I want, without creating the others",0
838,Yung,"I like this, but I'm wondering if anyone else can see any pitfalls",0
838,Miquel,delay is under-utilized imho,0
838,Miquel,"a fun fact - force is an alternative for deref on delays, and is identity on non-delay values",0
838,Mohammad,"will still blow the stack, no?",0
838,Miquel,only if you eagerly call it recursively,0
838,Miquel,but it is easy to make a non-stack-consuming recursion that goes into deeper delays as far as you like,0
838,Mohammad,like with a continuation,0
838,Miquel,"right, a delay is a zero arg continuation, effectively",0
838,Miquel,thunk? maybe that’s the word,0
838,Mohammad,yep,0
838,Miquel,"anyway, that overloaded behavior of force makes it convenient to write code that may or may not hit a delayed value",0
838,Yung,you've lost me now :slightly_smiling_face:,0
838,Miquel,thunks / continuations are how lazy seqs are implemented,0
838,Miquel,and delays do the same thing,0
838,Miquel,it’s a function that stands in for a value we might access later,0
838,Mohammad,Yung: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation-passing_style>,0
838,Miquel,"Mohammad: that article mentions a continuation being a one arg function, which is why I was particular about argument count - these being zero arg",0
838,Miquel,<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunk> whereas thunks are zero arg,0
838,Yung,so actually my first attempt was to change ``` :left (make-lazy-tree {:in (conj in (first indices)) :out out} (rest indices)) ``` to ``` :left (fn [] (make-lazy-tree {:in (conj in (first indices)) :out out} (rest indices))) ``` and then I could traverse the tree by calling the function returned by :left. Is this what is meant by continuation?,0
838,Miquel,that’s what’s meant by thunk,0
838,Yung,"ah ok, cool, im happy to be learning this",0
838,Mohammad,"yeah, it's cool stuff, and more common in the FP world",0
838,Yung,thanks for your help,0
838,Mohammad,Miquel: what would be the pros/cons of `delay` vs a `fn` in this case?,0
838,Miquel,"a delay is a way of making a function that gets called only once when forced, whereas a function could get called more than once and would not cache the prior result (unless you memoized…)",0
838,Miquel,delays are a more specific feature for this purpose so they eliminate some gotchas and boilerplate that come up in usage,0
838,Miquel,Mohammad: it has a function inside <https://github.com/noisesmith/clojure/blob/master/src/jvm/clojure/lang/Delay.java>,0
838,Miquel,apologies for linking to my fork but that file is unmodified,0
838,Miquel,another usage of delay I’m fond of is replacing nested lets inside conditionals with a let containing delays with conditionals that force certain delays as apropriate in a cond block,0
838,Miquel,"additionally, the delays can force another let bound delay inside their body, which simplifies tricky side effect tracking",0
838,Rubie,noisesmith: ew :P,0
838,Rubie,that sounds very.. imperative,0
838,Miquel,it’s something I only need for very imperative tasks,0
838,Miquel,"where I’m maybe getting a resource, maybe retrying, maybe cleaning up and bailing, etc. and it doesn’t fit a with-open or try/catch/finally well",0
838,Miquel,eg. trying to use zookeeper in clojure where every operation potentially requires me to re-try or fail,0
838,Miquel,(not coincidentally I am moving away from using zookeeper so I can avoid having to write code like this),0

I want to read a stream with unknown number of lines (e.g. a file) and fire an async get request per each line (lets say using an http-kit async get with `(go (&gt;! c response))` as a callback). then, read the responses one by one into another file. is there an elegant way of closing the channel making sure I am not missing any async puts into the channel? I can do so with putting my own guard msg at the end but it feels awkward.",1

845,Chanell,Kymberly: the producer might close the channel before the last response is put there,0

846,Alease,"Can anyone either give me some thoughts or tell me the best place to ask about some architecture issue I'm trying to sort out? Long story short, I have a Clojure + Clojurescript web app that needs to extend itself as a desktop app and as a user-owned server (with web admin api) that can have user created functions (think add-ons, plug-ins, arbitrary user code). I'm trying to find the best way to implement these two new pieces that highlights ease of installation, extensibility, minimal system requirements, and shared codebase as much as possible. The desktop app itself is surely going to end up being electron-based. As far as the code, there's a ""simulation"" engine that I don't want to rewrite in multiple languages unless from scratch to be shared, and is currently in .cljs files. My ideas thus far are - Option 1: Write the user-run server in Clojurescript + Node.js (running on node.js as the server) with user-defined JavaScript functions that get called from Clojurescript/JavaScript, and expose the Clojurescript API via externs Option 2: Write the user-run server in Clojure and run a v8 instance where I eval anything written by users in pure JavaScript, returning and sending json to communicate (at the cost of some speed and cruft). Any other ideas or thoughts? Or anywhere someone can point me? Thanks.",0

850,Zack,"So I am using an exception tracker that has mediocre clojure support (Sentry), but I'm working to improve it. Exception ""rollup"" (grouping of exceptions based on their similarity) relies on the hash of ""in-app"" stack frames (frames that begin with com.myapp for instance) being equal to a previously seen exception's stack frames. I believe rollup is not working across runs of my application due to anonymous function names differing. So, for instance: `com.myapp$fn__12345` is the name right now, but on the next run it may be `com.myapp$fn__99999`. Are there other patterns in clojure stack traces beyond `foo.bar$fn__12345` that I should let the maintainers know about which are specific to clojure, so exception rollup works as intended?",0
850,Barbara,Zack: check <https://github.com/hcarvalhoalves/raven-clj>,0
850,Barbara,the way its sending the tracebacks seems to make Sentry happy (it manages to group by Exception type nicely),0
850,Zack,Barbara: I'm kind of meh on manually reading source files from disk with no cache and parsing the exception object by hand. This is something that can be accomplished on the server side.,0
850,Zack,"As of a week ago or so, the `getsentry` folks picked up coda hale's wrapper around `raven-java`.",0
850,Zack,One other thing to add in case you're interested: I skipped the need to have `in-app` by simply setting the package names of my app as a param on the `DSN`,0
850,Zack,"Finally, I spoke with the sentry maintainers and they said it would be no problem to just fix the hashing of the problematic frames.",0
850,Zack,"Barbara: err maybe one more thing: I tried variations on what you're using, and I still managed to have mixed results. I fixed that same `nth` `IndexOutOfBoundsException` for `:context_line` for instance. Here's the ""official"" sentry-clj lib now -- PRs as I understand it, are welcome: <https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-clj>",0
850,Barbara,IMO the killer feature is having source code context around the error,0

866,Miquel,right - but many functions are lazy,0

866,Miquel,including concat,0

866,Deon,yada seem to have implemented something themselves <https://github.com/juxt/yada/blob/master/ext/oauth2/src/yada/oauth.clj>. Maybe its time we see a new repository appearing under your github account :wink:,0
867,Veda,Does anyone know how to store state in one instance of a simulation in `clj-gatling`? /edit Answer from the docs: <http://i.imgur.com/SISAxzT.png>,0
867,Veda,Hmm looks like the `context` is passed along in every step. Hopefully I can just assoc.,0
867,Veda,That’s not it. `assoc`ing to that context is not persistent,0
867,Veda,over steps,0
867,Veda,"One solution is to keep a separate database, but it is not very clean",0
867,Veda,Aaah you can send the context forward,0
867,Veda,Return `[result context]`,0
867,Veda,"Next question: in `clj-gatling` my response times are way longer than they actually are. It seems like it is not only counting the time my request takes, but also the time it takes to run on my computer. Is there a way to fix this?",0
867,Veda,"When I time the request ``` (defn login-request [ctx] (go (time (let [{:keys [status] :as res} @(http/get ""<https://www.google.com>"" {:headers {""Accept"" ""text/html""}})] [(= status 200) (assoc ctx :state ""state"")])))) ``` It prints “Elapsed time: 200ms”. But the end result in the Gatling reports states it lasts longer than 1200ms.",0
867,Deon,why is it wrapped in a go block? Is clj-gatling designed around this,0
867,Deon,cause you're doing a blocking call with @?,0
867,Veda,Well spotted,0
867,Veda,If I don’t wrap it in a go-block the same problem occurs,0
867,Veda,I think if I use ```(defn- http-get [url _] (let [response (chan) check-status (fn [{:keys [status]}] (go (&gt;! response (= 200 status))))] (http/get (str base-url url) {} check-status) response))``` like in the example things will work.,0
867,Veda,<https://github.com/mhjort/clj-gatling-example/blob/master/src/clj_gatling_example/simulations.clj>,0
867,Veda,Okay not using a go block works!,0
867,Veda,"This works: ``` (defn login-request [ctx] (let [check-result (fn [{:keys [status]}] (= status 200))] (http/get ""<https://www.google.nl>"" {:headers {""Accept"" ""text/html""}} check-result))) ``` No problem :slightly_smiling_face: Up to 4000 users",0
868,Paulina,"How can I refer to a var inside ns1 when the macro defined in ns1 is called from ns2? ``` (ns ns1) (defn a-fn* [] ""hello"") (defmacro a-marco [] `(defn a-fn [] (a-fn*))) (ns ns2) (ns1/a-marco) ;=&gt; Can't refer to qualified var that doesn't exist ```",0
868,Rubie,that's going to work,0
868,Rubie,"I don't believe you see that error message on a fresh repl, you must have some stale state",0
868,Rubie,"also that macro is slightly wrong, should be ``` (defmacro a-macro [] `(defn ~'a-fn [] (a-fn*)))```",0
868,Rubie,needless to say macros like that are discouraged in clojure,0
868,Alice,"I'm playing with an event sourcing/CQRS style system in Clojure. It involves some number of load-balanced app servers. My idea is to have local in-memory caches, and then ""catch up"" by applying pending events before any read operations.",0
868,Alice,I'm trying to avoid having any extra pieces like a message queue,0
868,Alice,does that seem sane?,0
868,Paulina,"Rubie: It worked, with the unquote-quote. But now I'm pretty discouraged.",0
868,Rubie,"generally, macros that inject global names into a namespace are not idiomatic in clojure",0
868,Rubie,"a slightly better version would be e.g. ``` (defmacro a-macro [name] `(defn ~name [] (a-fn*)))``` but still, this doesn't look like a very useful macro",0
868,Bunny,"they have their uses, probably finding out what is the goal is a step to take before judging something as not idiomatic",0
868,Rubie,why would you intern a var in a namespace that just delegates to a var in another? just refer that one directly,0
868,Rubie,"coming off as judgmental was not my intention, if that's how it came across",0
868,Ignacia,``` #'ns1/a-marco ```,0
868,Paulina,"delegating is part of if, passing some variables, but not all is the other half (something like partial, but on macro level)",0
868,Paulina,I couldn't use `partial` because what's passed might be an atom that needs to be derefed later.,0

870,Rubie,you can't in clojure,0

870,Rubie,"right, you can do that if you're in control of new types but it's simply not possible to retrofit on existing types like `java.util.HashMap`",0
870,Rubie,"(and even it it could be possible, `conj` is defined as an operation on persistent colls, so on mutable ones it would be breaking its contract)",0
870,Mariette,"okay, so If I want to wrap something, for example `Array[ResultSet]` to vector of map. I can't just extend-type, I should iterate it.",0
870,Mariette,thanks for help!,0
870,Miquel,"Mariette: you could define a multimethod which is identity for vector of hashmap, but uses `into` to populate clojure datatypes if it gets arrays and java.util.HashMap",0

871,Hannah,"``` :keystore ""path to file"" ```",0
871,Hannah,any idea why this is happening?,0
871,Hannah,:cold_sweat:,0
871,Lila,it means the ssl server and your browser are unable to agree on a cipher suite,0
871,Lila,which is likely due to using an out dated version of either,0
871,Alice,BTW I would strong recommend *against* doing SSL termination in Jetty,0
871,Alice,it's much better to do it with a reverse-proxying load balancer,0
871,Alice,e.g. NGINX or an ELB in AWS,0
871,Alice,you can do SSL termination in Jetty just fine but it just doesn't seem worth the effort when other tools do it better,0
871,Alice,"if you really really really need one host to serve up HTTPS from a single Java process, then sure",0
871,Alice,otherwise you're probably already deploying your app behind something that can do SSL termination,0
871,Alice,or you should be,0
871,Alice,"sorry, <#C03RZGPG3|off-topic> and uninvited advice",0
871,Alice,"but if you're developing a web app in Clojure, trying to set up SSL in Jetty is probably pretty orthogonal to the real problems you're trying to solve",0
871,Hannah,yeap!!! actually jetty is working well for what I need!!!,0
871,Hannah,maybe there are other complex things which are not supported or they are better with other server!,0
871,Alice,it's more about *not* doing it,0
871,Alice,when you don't have to,0
872,Ivy,"So what resources exist for learning deployment? My app is Clojurescript with a Clojure REST api, I have a dedicated ""server dude"" but I don't know that he'll know what to do with me. I'm assuming for Clojurescript I'd just NGINX-up the html and js file that makes the app go round, and for clojure I guess I could just run my Compojure rest api, but that leaves the question of how tf do I load balance that and etc. I have a ton of questions about this, so if anyone has a clojure/script deployment bible, smack me with it",0
872,Hassan,"Ivy: I think the answer is “the same way you’d do any JS / JVM combination web app” really — load balancing etc, and most of the deployment considerations, aren’t Clojure-specific. I know that doesn’t help but…",0
872,Alice,Ivy: your Compojure rest API should be able to serve the HTML and compiled cljs,0
872,Hassan,"I can tell you what we do at World Singles: we host the HTML and JS on S3 and serve that up through Amazon (using their CDN, DNS, etc) and the Clojure code gets wrapped up as uber JAR files and deployed to a bunch of servers and spun up with `java -jar` via scripts/services, and proxied via Apache, and F5 load balancers etc.",0
872,Hassan,"We have a separate deployment chain for front and back end components — since they are actively developed on different schedules, by different teams.",0

872,Alice,:slightly_smiling_face:,0
872,Alice,"every project starts out fresh and beautiful, and then reality hits",0
872,Alice,At least it's not a Clojure uberjar that starts up Jetty with an embedded JRuby on Rails *and* Spring web app loaded from precompiled WAR files.,0
872,Alice,where the Rails app calls the legacy Spring app to provide a REST API :slightly_smiling_face:,0
872,Alice,and the Clojure code is creating DAO objects to be loaded by the Spring app via dependency injection,0
872,Alice,all in one process!,0
872,Rodolfo,That sounds terrifyingly specific.,0
872,Alice,"I mean, just a hunch, but I think a project like that would be pretty crazy.",0
872,Alice,it would be even *worse* if the Spring app only communicated via SOAP,0
872,Randall,now i’m super curious to know explicitly if you’ve had to work on such a thing and how it came to be,0
872,Alice,you should be :upside_down_parrot:,0
872,Alice,I can make up more totally hypothetical aspects too,0
872,Alice,"like if you couldn't instantiate classes like (Foo.) but instead had to look them up by name every time, and the bulk of the code was interop requiring lots of this sort of thing",0
872,Alice,or static method invocations,0
872,Alice,without being able to do (Foo/bar),0
872,Alice,that would be silly,0

873,Geraldo,"`(format ""hello {:foo}"" {:foo ""world""})`",0
873,Geraldo,or something,0
873,Miquel,that’s close to how selmer does templates <https://github.com/yogthos/Selmer>,0

873,Miquel,I wonder if something similar could be hiding deep in `clojure.pprint/cl-format`,0
873,Geraldo,"I should probably just use format and not be a lazy person. I dont have a special use case, I just margianlly prefer the syntax",0

875,Alice,good catch!,0
875,Alice,vectors are functions of their indices,0
875,Alice,I forgot about that,0
875,Mohammad,"yes, just have to be careful with index out of bounds with the `(mapv v indices)` version. Can filter out `nil`s from the `get`-based version and not have to worry about exceptions.

877,Veronica,A quick question: Clojure supports closure where the closure has access to data defined in the parent function.,0
877,Veronica,"On the other hand, you can re-assign a new value to an existing variable. And this variable might be visible to the closure.",0
877,Veronica,Doesn’t this cause data race?,0
877,Veronica,Isn’t this some kind of mutable shared state?,0
877,Ignacia,"if your data are atoms, why not?",0
877,Veronica,Suppose that they are atoms.,0
877,Veronica,I see. In this case it won’t be data race.,0
877,Veronica,But it will still be a shared mutable state (but in a safe way),0
877,Veronica,Is that correct?,0
877,Ignacia,"well, more or less — yes",0
877,Ignacia,You just have to remember what atoms really are,0
877,Ignacia,"and no, there won't be data race (at least there shouldn't be :)",0
878,Edda,Hey! Could anyone recommend me a great Clojure book for someone who is new to the language but mostly familiar with functional programming? I have already read Clojure for the Brave and the True,1

878,Edda,Thank you!,0
878,Amina,"The Joy of Clojure is advanced, and I’m not sure if you need that much info upfront. I maintain that Programming Clojure by The Pragmatic Bookshelf is by far the best resource available, and written in a style that is true to the language. There is a new 3rd edition coming up, see <https://pragprog.com/book/shcloj3/programming-clojure-third-edition>.",0
878,Arlinda,`Clojure Applied` is also one to look at,0
878,Edda,Amina: thank you! How advanced are we talking about here with regard to the Joy of Clojure?,0
878,Amina,You should have written something in the language already to really benefit from the book.,0
878,Amina,"I wouldn’t rush into it, personally - I’m into my second year doing Clojure commercially after years of FP in Erlang and hobby toying around with Clojure/Scala, and I’ve yet to seriously touch the book.

878,Amina,"This is also the reason why I like Programming Clojure so much - the book doesn’t faff around and goes straight to the point, all the while (indirectly) teaching you all the good habits required for writing nice, clean, composable Clojure code.",0

878,Amina,"I have both the paper and the electronic version of the second edition, which covers version 1.3.

878,Edda,It’s one of those languages (Erlang) that is on my “to learn” list but never quite got around to doing it,0
878,Edda,And did you have a good time with Erlang?,0
878,Amina,"Clojure is a much better language. Erlang is more interesting from a concurrency perspective than an FP one, since the FP there is completely incidental (it was deemed necessary to implement the platform) rather than intentional. Both teach you something new, so if you feel like learning something else after Clojure I can recommend it. I enjoyed my time with Erlang but after 4+ years of it I think I’ve exhausted the platform, and I personally don’t think it’s the right fit in 90% of modern distributed/concurrent system development as a lot of the big selling points (failure handling, concurrency etc.) have been implemented outside of the VM these days and I just think that’s the right way to do it instead of having to think about these explicitly within a service.",0

879,Modesta,and what about `foo*`? `foo*2` or `foo2*`?,0

879,Modesta,"stu halloway was in town last week and made a big deal about ""alpha"" merely meaning ""subject to change"" and not ""low quality"" or any of the other associations",0
879,Vincenza,yeh I've been using Spec for a couple of projects &amp; its great!,0
879,Miquel,"yeah, clojure alphas tend to be quite good (as long as you are willing to rewrite code that uses the new features)",0
879,Porter,`real-foo` :stuck_out_tongue:,0
879,Modesta,Porter: and `real-real-foo` for the next one?,0
879,Porter,yes,0
879,Porter,only then can you go `real-real-foo-2`,0
879,Porter,after that its `real-foo-final` and that's all the `foo` you need,0
879,Modesta,Okay phew,0
879,Chieko,Is it good practice to use `(get a-collection :a-key)` over `(:a-key a-collection)`?,0
879,Miquel,I use get only if the keyword is in a bound name and not a literal,0
879,Miquel,"when it's a literal, it's always clear what the keyword is doing",0
879,Chieko,"Whereas if it’s in a bound name, it’s ambiguous whether it’s a function, keyword or what-have-you. Gotcha.",0
879,Vincenza,"eh I use keywords, vectors and maps as functions - because they're all functions",0
879,Chieko,Fair enough,0
879,Vincenza,so what if it might seem ambiguous - if it works and you've tested it then it's clear by the fact that they're first in the list that they're supposed to be a fn,0
879,Dong,Vincenza: you should only vectors/maps as functions when they are guaranteed to be non-null (because otherwise you’ll get an npe),0
879,Miquel,"Vincenza: my concern is readability and refactorability, I like to use constructs that reduce ambiguity when they are available and they don't impede other development goals",0
879,Vincenza,"Dong: naturally, but then anything could be nil and cause a NPE - that's part of testing &amp; maybe Specing",0
879,Dong,"no, using a keyword as function (or get) will not have that behavior",0
879,Miquel,"but using get directly is free, and solves the issue",0
879,Vincenza,"I don't think it affects readability at all, actually it's more clear sometimes",0
879,Miquel,I strongly disagree,0
879,Alice,I only ever use keywords like `(:foo bar)` when it's exactly like that: a keyword literal and a very simple form,0
879,Alice,if I want to get a default value I use `get` like `(get bar :foo :default)`,0
879,Alice,never `(:foo bar :default)`,0
879,Chieko,It’d certainly be easier to see what `(get a-collection unknown-thing)` is doing as opposed to `(unknown-thing a-collection)`,0
879,Alice,:point_up:,0
879,Vincenza,why is your unknown-thing unknown ?,0
879,Vincenza,just ensure it's a keyword,0
879,Alice,because we aren't using Haskell,0
879,Vincenza,"no we're using a better language, with a REPL and Spec",0
879,Alice,:stuck_out_tongue:,0
879,Alice,Clojure lets you inspect the state of things *after* you run your code,0
879,Alice,which is nice,0
879,Vincenza,"running a compiler (which is a program) to infer what your program _would_ do if run, is no more powerful than simply running your program",0

882,Alice,but you described a debugger with breakpoints,0
882,Alice,so,0
882,Ivy,I suppose it's similar,0
882,Ivy,but it's less about defining breakpoints,0
882,Ivy,and more about deducing where the issue is exactly programmaticallyy,0
882,Alice,stack traces get you most of the way there,0
882,Alice,the trick is defining the starting point of tracing executing,0
882,Ivy,"It'd probably be something you defined in the code, which may be cumbersome",0
882,Ivy,(trace this-ns),0
882,Alice,Breanna: well as suggested you can trace the fns in a namespace,0
882,Alice,`(trace-ns some.problematic.namespace)`,0
882,Ivy,I'm gonna write the best damn debugger that ever did darn dun existed,0
882,Alice,but you have to specify each namespace and/or function that you want to show up in the trace,0
882,Breanna,Cider has trace built-in if I remember correctly so you might not even need to evaluate that at the repl,0

890,Amina,I’ve been doing a bit of reading about functors recently and it just occurred to me that transducers might be exactly that. Only touched the tip of the iceberg so are they really the same thing or is there a counterexample of a transducer that cannot be classified as a functor?,0
890,Miquel,"`(map f)` can't be mapped over, so it isn't a functor",0
890,Miquel,in fact I can't think of any transducer that you can map over...,0
890,Charlsie,transducers exist outside of collections,0
890,Amina,functors are really type classes so they’re not tied to concrete types from the get go either,0
890,Miquel,"right, but functors are things you can map over, and though you can map over a function, I don't know how I would apply that to a transducing function",0
890,Miquel,perhaps that's my ignorance though?,0
890,Amina,(Or at least in their Haskell implementation they are. After years of Erlang and Clojure I feel a little bit like Alice in Wonderland reading about all that stuff.),0
890,Miquel,"doing some reading to refresh my knowledge of this stuff, supposedly mapping over a function is composing it, and transducers are functions that when called on another function return a function that will compose their transducing actions when applied in a transducing context",0
890,Miquel,"but I don't know how to translate ""transducing context"" here",0
890,Amina,"^ yeah, that’s the angle I was coming from",0
890,Miquel,"because looking at typical haskell examples `(+) 3` doesn't get applied to `(*) 2` to return a new function, it gets composed to make something you can apply",0
890,Miquel,which isn't what transducers do...,0
890,Miquel,in fact they are inside out of that right? you apply them to get something that composes the two,0
890,Miquel,I feel like I'm over my head with all of this though honestly,0
890,Amina,_thinking this through_,0
890,Le,apparently functors must preserve the identity mapping. ie identity in Category C maps to identity of Category D. If a transducer returns a non-empty list when given an empty list then it could not be a functor. (the categories being the collection of lists of the underlying set). This is my thinking.,0
890,Miquel,"so does this mean transducing mapcat, filter, remove, etc. are not functors but transducing map is?",0
890,Le,"asking the wrong person. got undergrad and graduate background in math but no idea about this. but start see if it makes sense by definition. ie, are the domain and codomain categories to begin with? If not the term has no meaning. To be categories we need the ""arrows"" on them and make sure they compose. blah blah. All I was looking for was a single counter example where a transducer would not behave according to the definition of a functor.",0
890,Miquel,:thumbsup:,0
890,Chantal,caio: you can also use something like this: <https://github.com/curiousprogrammer-net/clojure-repl/blob/master/src/clojure_repl/java.clj#L40>,0
890,Barbara,there's also state (<https://github.com/matthiasn/talk-transcripts/blob/master/Hickey_Rich/Transducers/00.36.36.jpg>) which suggests to me transducers are it's own thing (hence why a new name),0
890,Barbara,((or maybe multiple things under the same umbrela name)),0
890,Miquel,"oh, right - functors can't be stateful like that",0
890,Irma,with `defmethod` is there an idiomatic way to handle “dispatch on anything in this set” instead of a singular dispatch value?,0
890,Irma,``` (defmulti foo :my-type) (demethod foo #{:a :b :c} [_] …) ``` instead of having to do ``` (demethod foo :a [_] …) (demethod foo :b [_] …) etc ```,0
890,Miquel,you could check for that set in your dispatch function and have that return ::foo,0
890,Miquel,remember your dispatch function doesn't have to just return the thing,0
890,Irma,"ah i see, then wire in a defmethod like :a-set and :b-set",0
890,Miquel,`(defmulti foo #(if (contains #{...} (:my-type %)) ::foo (:my-type %)))`,0
890,Miquel,then `(defmethod foo ::foo ...)`,0
890,Miquel,"I think that is the simplest choice (with a better dispatch function of course, that's just the basic concept)",0
890,Irma,"great, that’s much nicer than what I was planning to do",0
890,Irma,any particular reason you use ::foo .. are defmulti’s global or something?,0
890,Miquel,"because who knows what value you would find, and namespaced things are safer? you can use any placeholder you like of course",0
890,Miquel,"Irma: part of my instinct to use ::foo there is to indicate ""this keyword is something my namespace cares about and maybe not generally relevant in other contexts""",0
890,Irma,i should probably be doing more of that. thanks again for the help,0
891,Paige,I use emacs and my cofounder uses Cursive. Is there a way to reconcile the formatting styles between the two so our code is consistent?,0
891,Miquel,my team uses the cljfmt plugin,0
891,Barbara,linter?,0
891,Barbara,best thing would be a linter as a post-commit hook,0
891,Lena,Paige: Cursive is fairly customisable for formatting settings. You can probably match most things that Emacs does,0
891,Buena,"Paige: If you have specific issues, let me know over in <#C0744GXCJ|cursive> and I’ll help you.",0
891,Miquel,with cljfmt I can even account for people that never remember to auto-format,0
891,Miquel,"before we started using it, we had repeated problems where person x would indent code totally wrong, and person y had parinfer turned on and moved all the parens around based on the indentation - there were two human failures that kept happening but just making sure cljfmt got applied to the repo was easier than fixing the bad code practices",0
891,Paige,I think it’s actually Emacs whose behavior seems to have more special cases. wondering if there’s a premade setting for either Cursive or Emacs? (surely I’m not the first one to try to reconcile the two),0
891,Le,from what i understand emacs will be more rigid and stubborn than cursive,0
891,Miquel,"that's why cljfmt is so great, it doesn't care what your editor is",0
891,Le,^,0
891,Le,and by rigid i mean less adaptable,0
891,Buena,"Miquel: You still really need your editor to agree with it though, or you will suffer pain.",0
891,Paige,Buena: ^ agree. and x2 with your partner’s code. the worst is when Emacs indentation breaks parinfer on Cursive- that actually changes the program’s behavior,0
891,Le,i'll bet your easier path is making cursive behave like emacs,0
891,Miquel,"Buena: just running it before I check my code in catches little stuff, and my editor is smart enough to catch changed files",0
891,Miquel,"always running it before commit, and always running it after a pull or merge is a pretty smooth workflow, even when some people forget to run their editor's indentor at all",0
891,Miquel,"to be clear I'm not just running cljfmt, I'm using the optional `fix` arg that edits all the files in place",0
891,Paige,"Buena: Miquel: cljfmt seems like a good first step, thanks for the suggestion. gonna give cursive formatting settings a shot",0
891,Buena,Paige: I think the main one that’s required to make Cursive line up with Emacs’ initial settings is _Settings-&gt;Editor-&gt;Code Style-&gt;Clojure-&gt;General-&gt;One space list indent_,0

893,Kesha,"Trying to build an ETL tool that downloads a zip file, unzips it, reads a specific file into memory, and then does some stuff to it.",0
893,Kesha,Ideally I could use .getNextEntry or something similar and read to memory when it matches a regex,0
893,Filiberto,Kesha: if you just need the information there is no need to unzip to files - you could read it file directly from the zip into memory,0

I've found that if I try to get the code working, as opposed to using stream of consciousness code as ""notes"", I spend a ton of time just making it work.

903,Linda,"Hello everyone, I have an app which generates documents (for example blog posts). Each document has an ID and consists of Text, Tables, Lists etc. and is completely defined in EDN. I want to store these documents but due to not consistent, changing keys it is not easy to store this in a RDBMS-Table.

904,Miquel,one thing to rule out would be that ca-certificates.postinst or the purge / reinstall of ca-certs didn't undo your custom cert addition,0
904,Miquel,there might be a less heavy handed way to add the cert and also make sure it updates java without doing a purge / install cycle...,0

908,Belkis,Edda: looks pretty stable to me: <https://github.com/clojure/clojure/graphs/contributors?from=2017-01-01&amp;to=2017-07-01&amp;type=c>,0
908,Edda,Is it ok to have side-effects in clojure specs? e.g. a database call. The application I am thinking of is checking that an email hasn’t already been used on a “signup” API payload,0
908,Rhea,Edda: only if idempotent,0
908,Dong,It's ok to validate things outside of spec too,0
908,Hassan,Edda: Clojure 1.9 is stable enough for production use as far as I’m concerned — my company has Clojure 1.9 Alpha 17 in heavy production usage right now.,0
909,Reid,"does anyone have recommendations on a good job scheduling library for Clojure? checked out Quartzite earlier, but had some difficulty getting it to play nicely with my loading of env vars from mount",1
910,Chantal,Should I follow kibit's recommendations? ``` Consider using: (vec costs) instead of: (into [] costs) ``` Is there any real difference between `vec` and `into []`? `vec` is a bit shorter and maybe more explicit but I've also seen `into []` being used a lot. I've found following question on SO: <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12044181/into-or-vec-converting-sequence-back-to-vector-in-clojure> but I don't think the different behavior for small arrays mentioned in answer is true,0

910,Chantal,"I see, any thoughts on my original question? :wink:",0
910,Miquel,"if the collection might in some cases already be a vector, or it's an array that won't be aliased, use vec",0
910,Miquel,"if you already have a vector and need to add to it, or if you need to do some transformation like mapping or filtering as you add things, use into",0
910,Miquel,"if none of those conditions apply, it doesn't matter which you use",0

917,Carlota,this gives me a list of the names of all the interesting nodes in my XML: ``` (xml-&gt; zipped :parameters :parameter (attr :name)) ```,0

927,Brittney,"ah, looks like `tools.analyzer` will do it",0
927,Brittney,"but AFAICT, it’s not possible in the built-in implementation",0
927,Wilhelmina,Wasn't aware of that limitation. Interesting.,0
927,Miquel,"Wilhelmina: the problem with resolve or ns-resolve is that the clojure compiler uses metadata on vars to decide if something is a macro, so using the var means it gets treated as a function - but! the fascinating thing is that this is a valid way to expand a macro, as long as you provide placeholders for &amp;form and &amp;env (nil here because I’m lazy and it doesn’t change the output) ```=&gt; ((resolve 'when) nil nil true :OK) (if true (do :OK))```",0
927,Miquel,"Brittney: so yeah, see above, just give workable &amp;env and &amp;form, and call the var instead of macroexpand the macro call and it works",0

927,Brittney,thanks!,0
927,Miquel,of course with macros that don’t access &amp;env or &amp;form (which is most…) two nils suffice,0

928,Suzann,hi all -- I'm using tools.cli and it's not clear how to pass multiple arguments to an option -- eg if I want an option to become a vector of numbers,0
928,Suzann,nevermind -- ended up taking it as a string and doing this - `:parse-fn (fn [input ](into [] (map #(Integer/parseInt (str %)) input)))]`,0
929,Liza,"This is rather odd, but has anyone experienced an issue where dereferencing agents of collections truncates some of the elements?",0
929,Miquel,remember that send and send-off can return before their action finishes - or even before it starts sometimes,0
929,Miquel,```+user=&gt; (let [a (agent []) f #(send a conj nil) g (fn [] (count @a))] (dotimes [_ 10000] (f)) (repeatedly 10 g)) (6622 6687 6716 6735 6757 6776 6794 6825 6851 6880) ```,0
929,Liza,Miquel: that's got to be it. I think I just got confused because I'm creating and returning the agent from inside a macro. That's where I see the trouble. If I create a `def` for the return value and then `deref` that it waits just long enough for the last results,0
929,Miquel,there's the function `await`,0
929,Liza,"Thanks, Justin! :slightly_smiling_face:",0
929,Liza,Oh...actually I didn't realize `await` depends on the `:done` key. I'm using an `int-map` so no keywords...,0
929,Miquel,what?,0
929,Miquel,"there's no magic :done key, await just lines up a lock that won't unlock until every pending action is done, then waits on it ```(defn await ""Blocks the current thread (indefinitely!) until all actions dispatched thus far, from this thread or agent, to the agent(s) have occurred.

929,Liza,"Oh, ok. I was confused by Clojure Docs: <https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/await>",0
929,Liza,I'll have to see why it's not still working,0
929,Miquel,one possibility is that something is calling send after you call await?,0
929,Liza,I would assume,0
929,Liza,Here's the macro:,0
929,Liza,I think `await` isn't doing anything since it can't know whether `pdiff` has finished,0
929,Miquel,it does do something - it waits on all actions that have been submitted before it is called - but you need something different if you want to wait on things pdiff might initiate after the point await is called,0
929,Miquel,also calling def on the output of gensym is super weird -why not a let block?,0
929,Liza,I'm confused as to what you mean in your second statement,0
929,Miquel,"def always creates namespace level bindings, using def with a gensym is weird because how would you even know which thing to look for later?",0
929,Miquel,"let is for locals, so I would expect let instead in a scenario like this",0
929,Liza,"Oh, the gensym isn't quasiquoted",0
929,Miquel,that has nothing to do with it,0
929,Miquel,def creates a new var in your namespace,0
929,Miquel,"oh - I see, you create the gensym def once",0
929,Miquel,that guarantees that pdiff-once is a race condition if it's used in two threads though,0
929,Nikole,What’s the purpose of the macro?,0
929,Miquel,that's another good question,0
929,Liza,"The purpose of the macro is to automate three calls in one: creating the agent, calling pdiff, and returning the contents of the agent",0
929,Miquel,"if two threads use that macro, the second one will replace the data used by the first",0
929,Miquel,it's extremely unsafe,0
929,Nikole,"Okay, but why not: ``` (defn pdiff-once [poly order] (let [tape (agent (i/int-map))] (pdiff poly tape order) (await tape) @tape)) ```",0
929,Christine,"why this: ```router=&gt; (if-let [{params :params} {}] (str ""params:"" params ""."") ""NOT-defined"") ""params:.""```",0
929,Nikole,Christine: because {} is not falsey.,0
929,Liza,"weavejester: let me try that. I'm not sure it'll work, but I'm relatively new to agents.",0
929,Nikole,`(if-let [params (:params {})] ...)`,0
929,Christine,Nikole: : thanks :slightly_smiling_face:,0
929,Nikole,"With if-let, the expression on the right needs to be `nil` or `false` to fail",0
929,Christine,trying to hit else if params not defined,0
929,Christine,Nikole: ok...,0
929,Nikole,Liza: You could also use a promise.,0
929,Nikole,"It depends what `pdiff` looks like, but a promise is more usual.",0
929,Miquel,I assumed an agent was being used because there were multiple alterations,0
929,Miquel,but doing that in a new thread makes using an agent problematic...,0
929,Liza,It works,0
929,Nikole,"The name `pdiff-once` also suggests a memoize, but it depends what you’re trying to do.",0
929,Liza,But `await` is not working,0
929,Nikole,"Liza: Could you give us an idea of what `pdiff` is doing, ?",0
929,Liza,`send` calls inside pdiff have not finished by the time `pdiff-once` returns,0
929,Liza,it's just associng values with `send`,0
929,Miquel,"if await returns, that means those calls weren't even made before await was",0
929,Nikole,`pdiff` is parallel diff I assume.,0
929,Miquel,you need some other way to know pdiff is done,0
929,Liza,This is exactly what I said previously...,0
929,Miquel,"you said ""await isn't working"" which I might have misinterpreted",0
929,Liza,"I said, ""I think `await` isn't doing anything since it can't know whether `pdiff` has finished""",0
929,Nikole,Would it be possible to post the definition of `pdiff` as well?,0
929,Liza,It's not going to make a difference,0
929,Miquel,"it could, if there was a way to ensure you don't return from pdiff until it makes all it's send calls for example",0
929,Nikole,"I’m not clear on what `pdiff` is doing, or why you’re using an agent. I assume it’s doing something in parallel.",0
929,Deon,Liza: do you get your functionality working without all the parallel stuff? Just plain idiomatic single-threaded clojure,0
930,Veda,"Does anyone know how to obtain the `Set-Cookie` header from `http-kit`, when you pass the `Cookie` header in the call as well? E.g., ``` (defn visit-url [{:keys [cookies url] :as context}] (let [result-chan (chan) check-result (fn [{:keys [status] :as response}] ;; TODO: get new cookies here....:/ not visible in response (log/error ""RESPONSE"" response) ; =&gt; no `Set-Cookie` (go (&gt;! result-chan (= status 200))))] (http/get url {:headers {""Accept"" ""text/html"" ""Cookie"" cookies} ; cookies is string of earlier obtained cookies :follow-redirects false} check-result) result-chan)) ```",0
1241,Steffanie,"Elm is an eager language, not laziness unless explicitly introduced",0
1241,Steffanie,"That choice was made back when we still did FRP, but some of the reasoning still applies - <https://groups.google.com/d/msg/elm-discuss/9XxV9L0zoA0/cx3UMZ05Gc0J>",0
1241,Jacob,"Michal: my version are elm 0.18.0, node 8.1.1, npm 5.0.3. Yes, I can see the “update: DoSignUp” in the console as well. But I was expecting the “Got the cmd” and data being passed around using the ports feature. That is not happening when I press the sign up button in the Main.elm page. Thanks again for the assist .",0
1241,Jacob,I’ll try a simple ports example and play around with that.,0
1241,Ok,"is there a quick way of getting the month number instead of the Month type, from a `Date.Date`",0
1241,Jewel,Introducing laziness in Elm would only lead to strange bugs where you’d have to introduce strictness functions at non-obvious places. Not so good for newcomers,0
1241,Bryan,hardfire: the Date.Extra package will let you if you don't mind adding a dependency — <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/justinmimbs/elm-date-extra/latest/Date-Extra>,0
1241,Ok,"Bryan: thanks , i might do that if have another Date-ish requirement again. Right now I just did my own Month-&gt;Int function",0
1242,Cassondra,"Miguel: i dont see logged content in the command line. Debug.log is supposed to print in the browser console, but there is none for the npm runner",0
1242,Steffanie,"When running Elm-test, it should just appear in the console",0
1242,Steffanie,"for example; I just added a `|&gt; Debug ""foo""` right before an expect, and see this: ``` Running 20 tests. To reproduce these results, run: elm-test --fuzz 100 --seed 287150092 foo: Ok (Branch ([Branch ([Val ""foo"",Val ""bar""]),Val ""foo""])) TEST RUN PASSED ```",0
1242,Cassondra,Ah. I was using Debug.log,0
1242,Eleanor,"Yes, `Debug.log` is what ilias meant",0
1242,Steffanie,"indeed, my bad. `Debug.log ""foo""` in this case",0
1243,Windy,Is there a way I can persist my model to localstorage ?,0
1243,Martin,"Is there some easy way of using relative address with websockets, like `WebSocket.listen ""<ws://localhost:8080/api>"" Msg` -&gt; `WebSocket.listen ""<ws://api>"" Msg`? Or do I have to create a task to retrieve `window.location.host` on start and use it to construct the url?",0
1243,Martin,Windy: <https://github.com/elm-lang/persistent-cache>,0
1243,Michal,"oh, I see-- ah, the ""Got the cmd"" output is from <https://youtu.be/X6e8KpPWHg0?t=10m20s> in entry.js which I think I delete later on.",0
1243,Chuck,Windy: I don’t think there is package out there currently but you can certainly do it with JS interop,0
1243,Windy,"Chuck: It looks like elm-lang/persistent-cache isn't released yet. Is it better to avoid it, then, and use JS interop, as you're suggesting, ?",0
1243,Chuck,Windy: I would think so,0
1243,Chuck,"It’s pretty straight forward process, just moving data between Elm the and DOM",0
1243,Windy,Does localStorage work if the app is served up via file:// instead of http:// ?,0
1243,Sheryll,"Martin: What I do for making Http requests work locally as well as on a live server is to start the elm application with flags, passing through the correct host and keeping hold of it in the model, no need for tasks.",0
1243,Chuck,"Windy: yes, since you are in the browser, you have access to localStorage",0
1243,Chuck,Sheryll: I think you still need to call a Task because it’s an async operation,0
1243,Chuck,"if you are calling your async operations in Elm than you will need a Task to run them, I believe, unless you are using JS interop to run your async operations",0
1243,Sheryll,"Martin: It’s not to run any async ops, just needs a way to start listening on a specific host. If you embed the elm application with flags, passing through the host, that can be stored on the model and then used in subscriptions to listen for websocket messages on the host without hardcoding the hostname in the elm source.",0
1243,Chuck,makes sense,0
1243,Sheryll,"```Elm.Main.embed(node, {hostname: window.location.host});``` after keeping hold of the hostname flag in the model (within init) this can then be used in subscriptions ``` subscriptions model = WebSocket.listen model.hostname Msg``` No need to create a task to get the hostname, just initialise the app with flags instead.",0
1243,Sheryll,"Martin: Also, if is using the `Navigation.program` instead of `Html.program` then the programs init function already gets a `Navigation.Location` object which the hostname could be plucked out from.",0
1244,Larhonda,hiya. two unrelated newbie questions here,0
1244,Larhonda,1. looking at <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/5.1.1/Maybe> and it shows int he example for `andThen` an operator `|&gt;` . what is that operator supposed to do?,0
1244,Larhonda,"2. is type annotation not available in the REPL? also, is there a way to create multiline functions on the REPL?",0
1244,Larhonda,"when i try to do type annotation, in the repl, i get the following error: ``` &gt; getFirstMonth : List Int -&gt; Maybe Int -- SYNTAX PROBLEM -------------------------------------------- repl-temp-000.elm A single colon is for type annotations. Maybe you want :: instead? Or maybe you are defining a type annotation, but there is whitespace before it? 8| getFirstMonth : List Int -&gt; Maybe Int ^ Maybe &lt;http://elm-lang.org/docs/syntax&gt; can help you figure it out. ```",0
1244,Larhonda,"i just figured out #2 , you need to terminate each line of a multiline with a `\`",0
1244,Larhonda,"i do remember reading that in the turtorial, but i forgot",0
1244,Larhonda,"so, just #1... type annotation ?",0
1244,Larhonda,and `|&gt;`,0
1244,Bryan,`|&gt;` is documented here — <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/latest/Basics#%7C&gt;> it's basically a way of sending the result of one function to another,0
1244,Larhonda,great. so like a pipe operator,0
1244,Bryan,yeah exactly,0
1244,Larhonda,makes sense. i think thats what they use in eilxir as well,0
1244,Larhonda,thanks!,0
1244,Bryan,"no worries :slightly_smiling_face: i'm not sure about type annotations in the repl, i don't use it much",0
1244,Larhonda,"kk, thanks for the insight!",0
1244,Chuck,"it works a little different in Elixir, just FYI",0
1244,Larhonda,"Bryan: , related question. when you say you don't use ""it"" much, are you saying you don't use the repl much or you don't use type annotations much (or both)?",0
1244,Chuck,same concept though,0
1244,Chuck,talking about the `|&gt;` operator,0
1244,Bryan,bkirkby: the repl; type annotations are super useful!,0
1244,Larhonda,:thumbsup:,0
1244,Larhonda,"at my current level of ignorance, they seem to be mostly aesthetic. which is useful, but types seems to be inferred really well. is that true?",0
1244,Bryan,"yeah the compiler is really good at inferring, but it can sometimes get confused with nested function calls",0
1244,Bryan,so explicitly listing what things should be just lets it tell you the actual problem if it's ambiguous,0
1244,Larhonda,"btw, the FAQ lised at the top is super useful. thanks for putting it together. i saw a different FAQ that was anemic before and i assumed what was in the channel topic was to that one.",0
1244,Larhonda,and for annotations in the repl: <http://faq.elm-community.org/#why-does-elm-repl-report-a-syntax-problem-for-any-type-annotation-such-as-for-fib--int---int>,0
1244,Larhonda,guess i need to delve deeper into the tooling and `elm-reactor`,0
1244,Steffanie,"as for type annotations: they help prevent bugs where the function doesn't do what you _think_ it does. By writing type annotations, you describe the actual shape of things your function is expected to work on, and what it is supposed to do with them. They also serve as a very succinct, formal type of documentation (there's even a search-engine that lets you look for functions based on their type). Furthermore, and this is fairly subjective, but I believe that writing things twice - once as a type annotation and once as an implementation - helps you mentally process things. It's sort of similar to the idea behind literate programming.",0
1244,Pamila,kinda like a type unit test for the compiler :stuck_out_tongue:,0
1245,Tiffiny,"Hi, I'm wondering whether anyone wants to give some general feedback on my little app on <https://github.com/dawehner/mfp-elm/tree/master/src> ?",0
1245,Miguel,dawehner: <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-community/random-extra/2.0.0/Random-Extra#sample>,0
1245,Tiffiny,"Miguel: oh nice, this is exactly what I need. Let me see how its actually implemented",0
1245,Miguel,It's still a `Maybe` because lists can be empty.,0
1245,Tiffiny,Fair,0
1245,Tiffiny,I guess one just skips the length checking,0
1245,Tiffiny,Miguel: Conceptually does it make sense to copy this single function or would you include the library via the package manager,0
1245,Miguel,I would just use the package. The core package is intentionally sparse. The elm-community packages are a semi-official extention.,0
1245,Miguel,I would move this: <https://github.com/dawehner/mfp-elm/blob/master/src/Update.elm#L15> to your model and pass it down as an argument.,0
1245,Tiffiny,"Miguel: good point. I started using a node based server for serving these, but then I switched to a simple static file.",0
1245,Miguel,Yep. Those sorts of changes are common. It's best to try and collect those together in the model so that you don't have to think about where they are when you need to change them.,0
1245,Miguel,"Looking around at the code for handling the 'active song', you are using a `Maybe.withDefault` only to turn around and hand it to `Just`",0
1245,Tiffiny,"ah I see, so this is basically elm's approach to constants?",0
1245,Tiffiny,"Well, there is no active song when the app loads, so I thought this is the usecase for a maybe",0
1245,Pamila,Thats actually fairly reasonable,0
1245,Miguel,re: constants: Kinda? It's more that putting things like this url data in the model is a practice that tends to lead to better code.,0
1245,Tiffiny,Yeah I can totally see that. It just makes it easier to understand what might go inside the app,0
1245,Miguel,"As for the active song, it's fine that it is a `Maybe`, I'm saying that your random song generator should return its `Maybe` without switching to a default.",0
1245,Tiffiny,ah gotcha,0
1245,Tiffiny,"well, then the question is, should I still use the SelectSong message?",0
1245,Tiffiny,At the moment it takes a Song,0
1245,Pamila,Whats with the Noop message?,0
1245,Miguel,`| SelectSong (Maybe Song)`,0
1245,Tiffiny,"Pamila: oh, right, I forgot to remove it",0
1245,Tiffiny,Miguel: so the click handlers should pass along (Just song) ?,0
1245,Miguel,Yes.,0
1245,Tiffiny,"great, thank you so much for all the feedback already!",0
1245,Miguel,<https://github.com/dawehner/mfp-elm/blob/master/src/Update.elm#L73> You should use `field` instead of `at`.,0
1246,Esmeralda,general note - your files are really short. In elm there is generally no need for that (there is a great talk by elm's creator that is not uploaded yet from elm europe explaining why in elm long files are fine),0
1246,Esmeralda,"if you're interested, the talk is here <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ihTgEYiKpI>, but it is currently unlisted as the videos are re-edited",0
1246,Tiffiny,Miguel: Esmeralda: I've seen that talk live indeed,0
1246,Tiffiny,Miguel: is field and at the same?,0
1246,Miguel,"`at [""key""] decoder` is equivalent to `field ""key"" decoder`",0
1246,Esmeralda,"ah well, why not restructure your app into one file :slightly_smiling_face:",0
1246,Miguel,`at` tends to communicate that you are digging deep into the structure.,0
1246,Tiffiny,fair I could do that. I am just used for my bigger experiments to grow out quickly,0
1246,Tiffiny,oh yeah I like to use the field as a sign of 1level communication,0
1246,Esmeralda,"if you follow that talk, splitting into update/view/... should never happen anyway. I did split by update/view for my earlier projects, and later reverted it, splitting along data lines instead.",0
1246,Miguel,"As for code organization, in contrast to other experiences you may have had, it's less important to get it 'right' from the beginning in Elm. The structure you end up making will often follow from your improved understanding of your application as you build it. It's also easier and safer to make changes because the compiler is picky, so moving code around is less risky.",0
1246,Tiffiny,oh yeah that is a good point,0
1246,Tiffiny,"I'm wondering whether its okay to put up another app, which though is bigger",0
1247,Luci,Martin: We did something like that here <https://github.com/rubinmarty/Codenames/blob/master/src/State.elm#L21-L30>.,0
1247,Luci,The trick is to use `Navigation.program` from elm-lang/navigation.,0
1248,Carmel,I'm having trouble understand what a `Value` is exactly. (Json.Decode.Value),0
1248,Steffanie,"It's a Javascript value. Could be anything, really, which is why you need decoders to make sense of it in our strictly typed universe",0
1248,Carmel,Steffanie: is it possible to create a `Value` in elm? Without it being passed in from outside?,0
1248,Miguel,Carmel: Look at `Json.Encode`,0
1248,Carmel,Thanks. Another question. I realized you can pass in arbitrary json to elm through ports and handle it as long as you have a record that represents that json. Is it possible to do the same with http request json? Or must I decode it manually?,0
1248,Miguel,You have to provide your own decoder to the `Http` functions.,0
1248,Carmel,So I cant just pass in the `value` decoder and then later on apply that value onto a `type alias`?,0
1248,Miguel,"Nope, you have to make your own decoder if you want to avoid hacky work-arounds.",0
1248,Miguel,(e.g. passing the value out of and back in via a port),0
1248,Carmel,"That's interesting, but hacky as well. Thanks for the help",0
1248,Carmel,One more random question. What are some tips for being productive with elm?,0
1248,Carmel,"I hope this isn't a FAQ. If so, a link to existing notes would be great also",0
1248,Carmel,"If I'm working on a module, how can I try it out without integrating it into my existing code? Unit tests?",0
1248,Carmel,"When I make a new feature, I usually have to rewrite it a few times to make it nice and elegant (including making it work first). Having to make a Main for each one is kinda tedious. Is there a better workflow?",0
1248,Muriel,"I personally prefer to see it as a part of the whole. i.e. ""Chase compiler errors until the feature is done"". But unit tests sounds reasonable to me",0
1248,Carmel,Maybe I don't have enough experience with the different features and how everything works. I see a bunch of errors and fall back on the workflow i just described.,0
1248,Muriel,It's an interesting question for sure :slightly_smiling_face:,0
1248,Miguel,Carmel: Code organization in Elm is likely going to be different from what you are accustomed to. I would advise not worrying so much about organization until after at least one round of refactoring. Don't go making a bunch of modules before you know that you need them.,0
1248,Carmel,"It's not usually the organization that's the issue more along the lines of, ""I've got this piece of json i need to get from the server, but I need to handle it in this way and how do I setup the decoding pipeline and etc to make it all work correctly (what records will I need, what unions types, etc.). I think this might just stem from a lack of understanding and experience with functional languages and elm",0
1248,Miguel,"Carmel: Probably. I think that starting from ""I've got this piece of json"" is often the wrong approach. I usually start by thinking of the data structures that I want and then figuring out how to build one given the API requests I have available to me.",0
1248,Carmel,"Maybe I could be more specific. ``` { ""type"": ""A"" or ""B"" or ""Error"" ""data"": some_json // Only if type == A or B ""error"": ""error message"" // Only if type == Error }```",0
1248,Carmel,"I wanted to decode that from a request I got. So I first had to figure out how to setup the get request, then what decoders I need (ok lets just use `value` and handle it down the line). Now how do I check the ""type"" field and decode based on what it is",0
1248,Carmel,"I've got it figured out now, but it took me a while and doing so in the original project (as I just used my workflow i described) would have led to a bunch of errors that would have kinda put me off",0
1249,Hallie,"Hi everyone. I wonder if I haven't discovered a bug in Elm. I have a simple select element with an options of countries. When I select a country, I need to select it twice for it to work. I don't get it. <https://screencast.com/t/GnvOvy2SMx1>. If I remove 'onInput ChgCountry', then the issue doesn't happen. If I add onInput ChgCountry, then the country I select becomes the right one in my model but I need to select it twice for the UI to reflect the choice. Did anyone have that kind of issue before? This happens just in that section on that Model. I have a similar code on another model but it doesn't happen. If I write the exact same code, in a function that doesn't display this element conditionally, then it works as expected. In the following screencast, the first country input is in the view that appears conditionally (depending on another selection), the lower country line behaves as expected, the select is changes without needing to select twice <https://screencast.com/t/1nPCurv3NQ>.",0
1249,Hallie,"```div [ class ""col-xs-7"" ] [ select [ class ""select form-control"", onInput (config.toMsg Location.ChgCountry), value config.model.country ] Addresses.countryOptions ] ]```",0
1249,Miguel,Hallie: :thinking_face:,0
1249,Muriel,That's a pretty vague question :slightly_smiling_face: Could you be more specific?,0
1249,Hallie,Let me try to be clearer,0
1249,Hallie,"Here is what I’m seeing. I have a Country field created using [this line of code, nested in a condition].",0
1249,Hallie,"```, div [ class ""col-xs-7"" ] [ select [ class ""select form-control"", onInput (config.toMsg Location.ChgCountry), value config.model.country ] Addresses.countryOptions ]```",0
1249,Hallie,"When a country other than United States is selected, the UI displays a different set of fields above the country field. This works as expected. However, what I’m finding, is that when I select a different country than US, “United States” continue to display instead of the country selected. I have to once again select a country for the field to update. If the line creating the country field is in the main view, it works as expected, if it is in the subview, displayed on condition of the m model, then I have that issue.",0
1249,Miguel,Carmel: Understanding composible data structures is *the* biggest stumbling block for new Elm users despite many difficulties. It's a big problem for a lot of FP languages.,0
1249,Hallie,<https://screencast.com/t/GnvOvy2SMx1>,0
1249,Miguel,Hallie: It *seems* to be a problem with the virtual dom losing track of what goes where. Have you tried setting `selected` on the selected option?,0
1249,Miguel,You might also try <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/html/2.0.0/Html-Keyed#node>,0
1249,Hallie,"I tried that selected model.country, but get the error that selected is expecting a Bool",0
1249,Hallie,```The argument to function `selected` is causing a mismatch. 88| selected model.country ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Function `selected` is expecting the argument to be: Bool But it is: String```,0
1249,Hallie,Since I don't know in advance what the bool is I am a bit confused as what I should put for selected,0
1249,Miguel,You have to put `selected True` in the currently selected `option` tag. But I think you should try `Keyed.node` first.,0
1249,Hallie,"Ok, thanks, I will try that",0
1249,Miguel,"``` countryOptionList id = List.map (\country -&gt; option [selected (country.id == id), value country.id] [text country.name]) ```",0
1249,Hallie,"Miguel: Ok, thanks",0
1250,Windy,Is there an Elm package for encoding my model to json? I want to store my model in localStorage.,0
1250,Miguel,Windy: `Json.Encode`?,0
1250,Windy,"Miguel: , how would you work with tuples?",0
1250,Miguel,Either in separate fields in an object or in a list.,0
1250,Miguel,"``` tupleToList : (a -&gt; Value) -&gt; (b -&gt; Value) -&gt; (a, b) -&gt; Value tupleToList xEncoder yEncoder (x, y) = Encode.list [xEncoder x, yEncoder y] ```",0
1250,Windy,"Miguel: I see, yes. Okay, I'll give it a whirl. Am I thinking about this right: the model gets encoded into json; that json gets passed to javascript side, which can then convert it to a string representation; it can then store that string in localStorage. To decode, reverse the process?",0
1250,Miguel,"A `Value` isn't actually JSON, it is a JavaScript value. You have to call <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/5.1.1/Json-Encode#encode> to turn it into a JSON string. You are free to do this on either side of the port.",0
1250,Windy,"Okay, thanks very much.",0
1250,Hallie,"Miguel: , thanks you for your help earlier, it did solve the issue!",0
1251,Brooks,"Hey all, wondering why `{a.b | c = d}` is not compiling? This type of `x...y | ...` merge seems pretty useful.",0
1251,Charlyn,"Brooks: the record update syntax requires a single identifier, so you can’t have `.` in there",0
1251,Yessenia,<http://faq.elm-community.org/#how-can-i-change-the-value-of-a-nested-field>,0
1252,Shae,"hey all, i've been scratching my head about this for a while: is there any way to achieve the effect of emitting multiple `Cmd`s _in order_ (i.e. not executed in random order, like in `Cmd.batch`) (the use case is that i'm using `port`s)",0
1252,Shae,so far the only workaround i could think of was: give a pair to all my `port`s that return `Sub`s which i could use to chain stuff (bloats the `port` module) or to use a timer to fire off the next `Cmd` in the chain,0
1252,Charlyn,Shae: there isn’t a way to order `Cmd`s besides having them go through `update`,0
1252,Charlyn,you can sequence `Task`s and things like http requests can be converted to `Task`s so they can be sequenced,0
1252,Shae,"Charlyn: how would having them go through `update` work? i would be OK with that workaround, but i couldn't figure it out either",0
1252,Charlyn,if you need to send a sequence of requests to a `port` you should make that `port` take a list of things to do,0
1252,Shae,"basically where i get stuck is that no matter what i do i can only fire off one `Cmd` at a time, but because these `Cmd`s come from `port`s they don't generate messages to keep the ""state machine"" moving",0
1252,Shae,"that was actually one of the earlier things i considered... but there i get stuck when providing the arguments (i tried heterogenous argument lists, but that didn't work 'cause heterogenous lists, and the only other option i could see was ""everything is a string"" which feels distinctively un-Elm-y :D)",0
1252,Steffanie,You can send out a json.encode'd value,0
1252,Shae,"ah yeah good point! i've seen that suggestion somewhere. however in this case i'm working with video image data, and i cringe at the idea of having to json encode every frame :smile:",0
1252,Charlyn,you can also use a tuple or a record,0
1252,Shae,ah nice,0
1252,Shae,i might try that,0
1252,Shae,"so basically i'd have a single `port` that takes `List (String, Args)` where the first element is the function name to call, and `type alias Args = { fn1Args: Maybe ... , fn2Args: Maybe ..., ... }`",0
1252,Shae,and all other methods in the `port` module are wrappers around that to provide the actual methods in some composable way,0
1252,Charlyn,Shae: You might also consider writing functions in JS for the various things you’d want to do from Elm,0
1252,Shae,"yeah, but then in theory i'd have to provide all combinations and orders of the various methods on the port api (granted, some of those don't make sense, but still)",0
1252,Charlyn,`ports` being async makes them a lot more like network connections than function calls,0
1252,Shae,"yeah, but e.g. as you pointed out with `Task`s there are built-in primitives for chaining them",0
1252,Shae,"anyway, thanks for the suggestions! i'll try them soon hopefully",0
1252,Charlyn,"yep, but `ports` can’t be converted to `Task`s",0
1252,Shae,"yeah i was just going to say that `Task`s seem to be the ""network connection"" type things in Elm",0
1252,Charlyn,the difference between `Cmd`s and `Task`s is that Tasks can fail and `Cmd`s can’t,0
1252,Charlyn,It’s been suggested to make ports return Tasks but this exposes your Elm app to the error prone nature of JS,0
1252,Charlyn,"ie. if you send on a port and never get a reply (because JS errored), what should the Elm app do?",0

1254,Elmer,Hi! I’m wondering how to model a dictionary in Elm which has arbitrary keys whose values are either a string or another dictionary (which in turn has arbitrary keys and values of String | Dictionary). Is this possible in Elm?,0
1254,Elmer,So far the only examples I’ve seen refer to Dictionaries which aren’t nested and whose keys are known.,0
1254,Eleanor,"What do you mean by ""arbitrary keys""?",0
1254,Jewel,for arbitrary keys you could use <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/eeue56/elm-all-dict/latest> and for values of either string or another dictionary you’d use a union type like so ``` type EitherStringOrDict = AString String | ADict YourDictType ```,0
1254,Beata,"I am an Elm beginner, but I think this might be possible using the union types?",0
1254,Elmer,"Arbitrary keys: {foo = ‘1’, bar = ‘2’} or {fuzz = ‘3’, bazz = ‘2’}. It doesn’t matter what the keys are called, nor how many of them are present.",0
1254,Terrie,Elmer: have you seen this package? <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/eeue56/elm-all-dict> It has an EveryDict that allows the Dict keys to be of any type,0
1254,Elissa,"Eh, I don’t think that’s what they want",0
1254,Elissa,"Elmer: , i think you just want a plain dictionary",0
1254,Eleanor,So the key can be of type `String`,0
1254,Elissa,"Here’s how your example would look: `Dict.fromList [ (""foo"", 1), (""bar"", 2) ]`",0
1254,Elmer,Elissa: but don’t I have to declare the keys and types then in my model?,0
1254,Elissa,"Yes. You cannot have varying keys in a record in Elm, because it makes the types impossible to figure out.",0
1254,Elissa,You can have multiple different records,0
1254,Elissa,But that’s different from varying keys.,0
1254,Elmer,Eleanor: yeah - the keys are String and the values are String | Dict,0
1254,Eleanor,"Jewel: I think you might be confusing how Dicts and records work. Records have certain named fields, with specific types per field. Dicts are collections of for key and value pairs, where the keys need to be of one single type (strings are fine), and the values need to be of a single type, but that includes the union type showed earlier.",0
1254,Jewel,"ok, so then ``` type alias YourDictType = Dict String EitherStringOrDict ```",0
1254,Eleanor,"yep, that",0
1254,Elmer,Eleanor: yep - I think you’re right there!,0
1254,Elmer,"Jewel: Thanks, - I’ll try that :slightly_smiling_face:",0

1256,Venice,at the moment I’m just hard coding it on the api,0
1256,Venice,and it’s just an array of strings,0
1256,Miguel,`Decode.list : Decoder a -&gt; Decoder (List a)` So you need to hand it a decoder for each item in the list and it will apply it across the whole list.,0
1256,Venice,"but later on, I want to use the api that returns objects: ``` {""ID"":1368,""title"":""Thomas Manss"",""content"":""&lt;p&gt;Decoration is just make-up for the wrinkles of the idea. &lt;\/p&gt;\n"",""link"":""https:\/\/quotesondesign.com\/thomas-manss-2\/""} ```",0
1256,Miguel,"Then it is `Decode.field ""myField"" (list string)`",0

1256,Venice,what does myField refer to in my case?,0
1256,Venice,a specific field like title?,0
1256,Miguel,"A field in the JSON object. If your top-level is a list of strings, you *only* use `(list string)`",0
1256,Miguel,"Right, so in the object you gave as an example, you might have `Decode.field ""ID"" int`",0
1256,Miguel,"If you want to decode the entire thing: ``` Decode.map4 mkThing (Decode.field ""ID"" int) (Decode.field ""title"" string) (Decode.field ""content"" string) (Decode.field ""link"" string) ```",0
1256,Venice,"I think I have a mistake in the import too, as it says Cannot find variable Decode.field",0
1256,Miguel,You can probably just use `field`,0
1256,Venice,```import Json.Decode exposing (..)```,0
1256,Miguel,or `import Json.Decode as Decode`,0
1256,Venice,ah ok,0
1256,Miguel,"Wenona: I don't know about elm-bootstrap, you might ask in <#C3U2E3JRX|elm-bootstrap>. Normally, you should use `Html.Keyed` to give the virtual dom extra information about when something is the same or different from something else.",0

1256,Venice,"I mean, define all of them in the type",0
1256,Miguel,"If you want to use all 20 fields to construct some type, you would need a function which could take all of those. Although, I might break it up into smaller pieces at that size.",0
1256,Lillian,"If you need to decode complex type aliases, you should look into elm-decode-pipeline <https://github.com/NoRedInk/elm-decode-pipeline> :wink:",0
1256,Venice,"I guess that makes sense elm-way. Oh and also in this example: <http://elm-lang.org/examples/http> ``` decodeGifUrl : Decode.Decoder String decodeGifUrl = <http://Decode.at|Decode.at> [""data"", ""image_url""] Decode.string ``` Why is this a constant? shouldn’t it be a function?",0
1256,Venice,oh wait mine is the same :smile: nvm,0
1256,Miguel,"One useful thing that you might not have noticed in the documentation is that: ``` type alias YourFancyRecordAlias = { id : Int , title : String , content : String , link : String } ``` This gives you an auto-generated constructor `YourFancyRecordAlias : Int -&gt; String -&gt; String -&gt; String -&gt; YourFancyRecordAlias`",0
1256,Venice,"yeah I saw that. But now I have tons of type related issues. so I created the type ``` type alias Content = { id : Int , content : String } ``` and then my decoder ``` decodeQuoteUrl : Decode.Decoder String decodeQuoteUrl = Decode.map2 Content (Decode.field ""ID"" <http://Decode.int|Decode.int>) (Decode.field ""content"" Decode.string) ``` but this gives me an error saying that it should be `Decode.Decoder Content`, not `String` for some reason. If I change that to `Decode.Decoder Content`, then this one goes crazy: ``` fetchRandomQuoteCmd : Cmd Msg fetchRandomQuoteCmd = Http.send FetchRandomQuoteCompleted fetchRandomQuote ```",0
1256,Miguel,Because `FetchRandomQuoteCompleted` is a constructor that takes a `String` not a `Content`?,0
1256,Venice,indeed it is :smile:,0
1256,Venice,damn it,0
1256,Venice,"ok one more question please. I want to extract just the content fields from that list, to have a list of string. how can I do that? I tried this ``` Decode.map String (Decode.field ""content"" Decode.string) ```",0

1262,Shae,"yeah, my understanding is that basically you can emit `Cmd`s in two places: either in your `update` or in your `init` function.

1263,Shelia,or not.. actually I don’t really see how to handle Cmds…,0
1263,Charlyn,Shelia: there are no components,0
1263,Charlyn,any updating you want to do to the model and any `Cmd`s you want to emit are done in the top level `update`,0
1263,Charlyn,that `update` can call any functions it wants to produce those `Cmd` and do those model changes,0
1263,Shelia,Charlyn: - you can obviously follow nested TEA and map child update to parent… sitll works,0
1263,Shelia,by component i am not talking about a stateful component but a pure component.,0

1263,Shelia,Shae: your example looks like the .17 nested TEA pattern,0

1263,Shae,"oh, this is just something i came up with as a first guess",0
1263,Shae,didn't know that this was an anti-pattern,0
1263,Shae,do you have any links about it?,0
1263,Shelia,@weiszman the pattern was completely scrubbed from “An Introduction To Elm” for .18. It was in the .17 version if i remember correctly,0
1263,Charlyn,Shelia: elm-sortable-table has a bunch of functions that modify it’s `State` type and a `view` function to display it as Html. If you want it to produce `Cmd`s then write a function that takes a Msg you want to `Cmd` to produce and have it return the `Cmd`,0
1263,Shelia,Shae: sorry i mean,0
1263,Shae,ah i see. i started with .18 so guess that's why i never encountered that,0
1263,Charlyn,``` getTheTime: (a -&gt; msg) -&gt; Cmd msg getTheTime msg = Task.perform msg Time.now ```,0
1263,Charlyn,"if your Cmd needs data from a `State` value, then pass that in too",0
1263,Shelia,Charlyn: elm-sortable-table does away with the table.update and Table.Msg . You configure a function to transform State -&gt; Msg right? That gets called in the table view… the role of table.update seems to be baked in to the table.view,0
1263,Charlyn,`view : Config data msg -&gt; State -&gt; List data -&gt; Html msg` view is a function that takes a `Config` and a `State` and some data and returns some Html to display,0
1263,Charlyn,elm-sortable-table exposes functions to operate on the `Config` and `State` values instead of hiding those functions behind `Table.Msg` values being passed to a single `Table.update` function,0
1263,Shelia,"Charlyn: yes. I see that. However, I don’t really see how you extend the pattern to account for the desire to produce a Cmd from the table. IE Lets say i am creating random-sortable-table which i want to handle from within the table… I don’t see where as the author of random-sortable-table i would orchestrate this….",0
1263,Shelia,Charlyn: and i know that i am being sloppy with my terminology. because i understand that the table isnt actually producing the random value….,0
1263,Charlyn,in response to a user action?,0
1263,Shelia,Charlyn: in response to an event defined in the table’s view and without having to define another Msg on the part of the consumer (other than the single Msg handling table state ),0
1263,Charlyn,"a user action produces a `Msg` which the Elm runtime passes on to your `update` function, from there you can call any function you want to.",0
1263,Shelia,but I ( the author of random-sortable-table ) don’t have an update function if i am following elm-sortable-table pattern. I have a view function. thats it.,0
1263,Shelia,The consumer of my api has an update function….,0
1263,Shelia,"Charlyn: i guess a more general question is why is nested TEA considered an anti pattern, and what is the alternative given the desire to hide implementation details from a consumer of an api?",0
1263,Charlyn,it’s considered an anti-pattern because it creates a lot of boilerplate which tends to lead to confusion,0
1263,Shelia,I have read this but i have not seen a clear alternative which allows for the same flexibility,0
1263,Shelia,"Charlyn: I have seen a lot of admonitions against using it, but the examples which An Introduction To Elm inserted in .18 in place of Nested TEA don’t apply to a package author…",0
1263,Charlyn,"Shelia: if you wanted to allow a column to be sorted randomly, you’d create a function that takes a random seed value and returns a `Table.Sorter` for that column",0
1263,Shelia,Charlyn: that was an off the cuff example. I am looking for a general strategy to adapt the pattern provided in elm-sortable-table to handle Cmds from the point of view of the api/package author.,0
1263,Steffanie,"I think the realization we've had was that there is no ""one size fits all"" solution - different requirements need different levels of abstraction, and defaulting to TEA as the abstraction boundary for everything does not simplify life for the consumer of packages. The abstraction boundary should be `function` which _sometimes_ means you need a view, update and state, and sometimes doesn't mean that.",0
1263,Charlyn,the general strategy is to write a function that returns the `Cmd` you want and put that function in your module.,0
1263,Shelia,Steffanie: that seems completely reasonable to me.,0
1263,Shelia,Charlyn: i believe that i am not articulating the question sufficiently. I understand how to write a general function which returns a command. I don’t however see in the specific case of the pattern in elm-sortable-table how to extend the pattern to handle commands. Perhaps it is just staring me in the face and i don’t see it….,0
1263,Shelia,"Steffanie: - I would have hoped that the literature teaching elm would have avoided scrubbing the pattern, as opposed to simply providing a number of different patterns… a la GOF",0
1263,Charlyn,"that’s it, you just add a function that the caller can call. You might want to have the caller pass in the `Config` and `State` to help construct the `Cmd`",0
1263,Charlyn,that’s all a `Table.update` would be doing anyway,0
1264,Eleanor,"The original ""A list of counters example"" in the Elm Architecture tutorial was where people got the idea of components from. I liked the idea too, and I still think it makes sense for certain things. But I completely agree with Ilias (and Evan's Elm Europe talk) here: there's no one-size-fits-all and especially as a package author you are responsible for creating the least complicated API for the user to get things done.

1267,Peg,"Hi, I'm new to Elm and I have some question about elm-test",0
1267,Peg,"I try to have multiple expect in the same test, but didn't find how",0
1267,Peg,so here is what I've done for now but it's not really expressive,0
1267,Peg,"``` suite : Test suite = describe ""2048-elm"" [ test ""moveLeftWithZero"" &lt;| \_ -&gt; let expectedCases = [ ( [ 2, 0, 0, 2 ], [ 4, 0, 0, 0 ] ) , ( [ 2, 2, 0, 4 ], [ 4, 4, 0, 0 ] ) , ( [ 0, 0, 0, 4 ], [ 4, 0, 0, 0 ] ) , ( [ 0, 0, 2, 4 ], [ 2, 4, 0, 0 ] ) , ( [ 2, 4, 2, 4 ], [ 2, 4, 2, 4 ] ) , ( [ 2, 2, 2, 2 ], [ 4, 4, 0, 0 ] ) ] toTest = List.map (\expected -&gt; ( (Tuple.first expected), (Main.moveLeftWithZero (Tuple.first expected)) ) ) expectedCases in Expect.equal expectedCases toTest ] ```",0
1267,Peg,I tried with `Expect.all` but it does not seems to do what I want,0
1267,Steffanie,"seems like those should be multiple tests, actually?",0
1267,Peg,for me it's the same test but with different data,0
1267,Peg,so it's not worth having multiple tests,0
1267,Peg,"anyway it's working like that but I wanted to do something more ""datadriven""",0
1267,Miguel,"Peg: I don't think this is how the `elm-test` authors want to construct tests. if you want to run a lot of cases through tests, it's generally better to write `Fuzz` tests. If you are set on doing this, however, I think you will need to roll your own helper function to handle it.",0
1267,Chiquita,"Miguel: : right, but fuzzing supposes to know how to compute the result of the function you want to test and independantely of your original implementation",0
1267,Chiquita,"with fuzzing, you have no control of the data your test generates, so you cannot challenge your test function result against a predefined computation",0
1267,Miguel,"I'm not going to argue the merits of `elm-test`, that is probably better left for <#C0CLGCMMF|testing>.",0
1267,Peg,"Chiquita: This another version thanks to ``` testMove when expected = test (""moveLeftWithZero"" ++ (toString when)) &lt;| \_ -&gt; Expect.equal expected &lt;| Main.moveLeftWithZero when suite : Test suite = describe ""2048-elm"" [ testMove [ 2, 0, 0, 2 ] [ 4, 0, 0, 0 ] , testMove [ 2, 2, 0, 4 ] [ 4, 4, 0, 0 ] , testMove [ 0, 0, 0, 4 ] [ 4, 0, 0, 0 ] , testMove [ 0, 0, 2, 4 ] [ 2, 4, 0, 0 ] , testMove [ 2, 4, 2, 4 ] [ 2, 4, 2, 4 ] , testMove [ 2, 2, 2, 2 ] [ 4, 4, 0, 0 ] ] ```",0
1267,Chiquita,"Miguel: don't get me wrong, I *love* the fuzzing in `elm-test`",0
1267,Peg,It suits my need really well :slightly_smiling_face:,0
1267,Steffanie,"yeah, having them as separate tests like that makes sense to me - if only one case fails, one case fails",0
1267,Peg,Steffanie: you're right but I wanted to avoid having boilerplate code and with an helper function it's really readable and easy to add another test case,0
1267,Chiquita,I've already seen another strategy that involves indeed fuzzing in this case,0
1267,Chiquita,it means you have to write a naive and non optimized implementation of the function you want to test,0
1267,Peg,anyway thank you folks helping me creating another 2048 clone in elm :smile:,0
1267,Chiquita,"and run it against your ""original"" function for your fuzzed set",0
1267,Eleanor,"And if you want to use the list approach, that can be done easily with a helper too: ``` testMove (when, expected) = ... suite : Test suite = describe ""2048-elm"" (List.map testMove expectedCases) ```",0
1267,Steffanie,or even `(uncurry testMove)` so you can keep your current implementation of it :wink:,0
1267,Peg,Eleanor: thank you but how will it fill `when` and `expected` const with the tuple value ?,0
1267,Steffanie,"in ohanhi's setup, `testMove` takes a tuple and deconstructs it. with `uncurry`, that's handled by elm",0
1267,Steffanie,"well, handled by `uncurry` :stuck_out_tongue:",0
1267,Peg,cool,0
1267,Chiquita,"hihi, `uncurry` is also another door toward functional programming",0
1267,Eleanor,"So that syntax I wrote will do the same as your `Tuple.first` and `Tuple.second`, but already in the function definition.",0
1267,Peg,I'll give it a try,0
1268,Brendon,"`datesInBetween: Date -&gt; Date -&gt; List Date` - does anyone know where to find a function that gives me all the dates between this 2 dates? ex: `datesInBetween ""20 June"" ""25 June"" -&gt; [ 20 June, 21 June, 22 June, 23 June, 24 June, 25 June ] `",0
1268,Brendon,there was a function doing this in one of the packages - i used it before - but can't find it now.,0
1268,Velma,basically `List.range` but for dates?,0
1268,Brendon,yes,0
1268,Cortney,Have you looked at Date.Extra?,0
1268,Steffanie,<http://klaftertief.github.io/elm-search/?q=Date+-%3E+Date+-%3E+List+Date> :disappointed:,0
1268,Velma,same when searching for `List Date`,0
1268,Steffanie,"there is, however, `dayList : Int -&gt; Date -&gt; List Date`",0
1268,Cortney,Also <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/justinmimbs/elm-date-extra/2.0.3/Date-Extra#range>,0
1268,Steffanie,"(also, five packages have a function name `orange`. Only 3 `apple`s, though.)",0
1268,Cortney,Hahahaha.,0
1268,Steffanie,"Waiting for someone to tell me one is obviously a colour and the other isn't, which means I'd be comparing apples to oranges.",0
1269,Nydia,"I am trying to do something, and with the approach I'm taking it seems I am fighting the language/type system Whenever I run in to this, I generally take a step back and reevaluate my approach; I am wondering if there is a better approach to what I am trying to do I have a page which should allow a user to edit a resource I fetch from a server. I have the json serialization/deserialization of this data structure, let's call it `Customer` codified as a type alias, and in the UI logic I simply aliased my Model to that same data structure, `Customer` Now I want to be able to add a `message` field to my UI model, in order to display the result of some interaction with the server. My first approach was to have the data structure, `Customer`, as a sub field in the model, like so: { customer: Customer, message: String} This approach turned out to be painful syntactically, as updating sub-records seemed to require a lot of overhead in code. On further reading, I learned of extensible records, and tried to define my model in a way that is the union of the `Customer` type and a type that has a message field: `type alias WithMessage a = { a | message : String}`; `type alias Model = WithMessage Customer` My first question would be, is this a good use case of extensible records, or is there a simpler way to achieve the same?",0
1269,Jewel,"Well, aren't you updating the entire Customer at once, since you are getting it from the server? I'd have it as a separate data field just because of that",0
1269,Caitlin,"Nydia: Usually when I have lots of messages that update a nested record, I nest those messages so I can do something like: ``` type Msg = CustomerChangeMsg CustomerMsg | OtherMsg | ... type CustomerMsg = ChangeName String | ... update msg model = case msg of CustomerChangeMsg subMsg -&gt; { model | customer = updateCustomer subMsg model.customer } updateCustomer msg customer = case msg of ChangeName newName = { customer | name = newName } ```",0
1269,Jewel,But your usage of extensible records is not wrong as a general principle for grouping fields,0
1269,Caitlin,That way I don't need ``` let customer = model.customer updatedCustomer = { customer | name = newName } in { model | customer = updatedCustomer } ``` in every case branch,0
1269,Caitlin,"I usually just use extensible records to limit the fields my functions expect/operate on, instead of using them to define actual data",0
1269,Nydia,"Jewel: Yes, I am updating `Customer` all at once. The extra field, message, that will exist in the UI's model was an initial concern, as I do not wish to communicate that as part of the `Customer` resource; the code serializing the `Customer` resource only serializes the fields that make up a customer, however I am thinking that was your concern with this approach, ?",0
1269,Jewel,"Well, I'm not really concerned :) getting the model right is important but refactoring is easy",0
1269,Nydia,"Caitlin: Ah , I had not considered that! I believe that would ameliorate the pain of updating nested records",0
1269,Nakita,"Seems to work, not the easiest thing I’ve ever set up though.",0
1269,Nydia,"Caitlin: Thank you , that approach worked out nicely",0
1269,Caitlin,Yup :slightly_smiling_face:,0
1270,Suzie,Hi everyone,0
1270,Suzie,"If my model looks like: ```type alias Application = { id : Int , term : Int , amount : Int } type alias Model = { application : Application } ``` and I am trying to update the `term` value, I have `onInput UpdateTerm` on an input inside my update case statement how do I update this value?",0
1270,Suzie,so far I have `UpdateTerm term -&gt;`,0
1270,Suzie,but unsure how I can update only the `term` value,0
1270,Elissa,<https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/user_input/text_fields.html>,0
1270,Suzie,Yes I’ve seen this,0
1270,Suzie,my issue is more updating the field inside appliction,0
1270,Steffanie,"you'd do it in two steps, something like this: ``` let application = model.application updatedApplication = { application | term = updatedTerm } in ({ model | application = updatedApplication }, Cmd.none) ```",0
1270,Velma,<http://faq.elm-community.org/#how-can-i-change-the-value-of-a-nested-field> ?,0
1270,Steffanie,"or, yeah, that :smile:",0
1270,Velma,"Alternatively, you break it into two functions: ``` setTermOnApplication : Int -&gt; Application -&gt; Application setTermOnApplication term app = { app | term = term } setTermOnModel : Int -&gt; Model -&gt; Model setTermOnModel term model = { model | application = setTermOnApplication term model.application } ```",0
1270,Suzie,cheers everyone :smile:,0
1271,Scott,Hi guys &amp; gals,0
1271,Scott,lol,0
1271,Scott,So slackbot needs to get smarter,0
1271,Scott,hahaha,0
1271,Scott,question... Is it possible to decode a deeply nested array into a flat `List` and not a nested type?,0
1271,Velma,yes,0
1271,Pamila,need to be a bit more specific but probably yes,0
1271,Velma,the shape of the JSON does not need to be replicated in your Elm types,0
1271,Scott,"``` json : String json = """""" { ""name"": ""Product"", ""attributes"": { ""format"": { ""id"": ""format"", ""name"": ""Format"", ""options"": [ { ""id"": ""a4"", ""name"": A4"" }, { ""id"": ""a3"", ""name"": A3"" } ] }, ""printing"": { ""id"": ""printing"", ""name"": ""Printing"", ""options"": [ { ""id"": ""4/4"", ""name"": 4/4"" }, { ""id"": ""4/0"", ""name"": 4/0"" } ] } } } """""" ``` A flat list of the options in this case",0
1271,Scott,"I'd like to create a type: ``` type alias Option = { id : String , name : String , attribute : String }",0
1271,Scott,"``` type alias Option = { id : String , name : String , attribute : String } ```",0
1271,Pamila,I think you need to bounce through a dictionary for this one and then issue the map,0
1271,Scott,mmm.. I was afraid of that. So I'd have to create the nested `Dict` and from that create the `List`.,0
1271,Velma,what does that `attribute` string map to?,0
1271,Pamila,presumably the key like `printing`,0
1271,Velma,"ah, so there would be multiple options where the `attribute` is `printing`",0
1271,Pamila,Scott: ^,0
1271,Velma,"If I understand correctly, you want the formatting and printing options together in a flattened list?",0
1271,Scott,Yes.. correct,0
1271,Velma,"OK, that should be possible without a `Dict`",0
1271,Velma,let me see if I can write up something,0
1271,Scott,Not that I would have multiple lists. Just one list of all the options. And the `attribute` would allow me to filter based on that.,0
1271,Scott,I thought that might be most efficient,0
1271,Steffanie,<https://ellie-app.com/3xfPcjxfy4ja1/0> something like that?,0
1271,Scott,check that out! Let me try to understand it.,0
1271,Velma,I wrote up <https://ellie-app.com/3xfTdwMjGCra1/0>,0
1271,Velma,Steffanie: looking at 's solution :eyes:,0
1271,Velma,ooh! `Json.Decode.keyValuePairs` super nice! TIL :thumbsup:,0
1272,Pamila,"are we playing code golf ``` itemdec : Dec.Decoder (List {attribute:String, id:String, name:String}) itemdec = Dec.map2 (,) (Dec.field ""id"" Dec.string) (Dec.field ""name"" Dec.string) |&gt; Dec.list |&gt; Dec.field ""options"" |&gt; Dec.keyValuePairs |&gt; Dec.map (List.concatMap (\(n,l) -&gt; List.map (\x -&gt; (n,x)) l)) |&gt; Dec.map (List.map (\(a,(i,n)) -&gt; {attribute=a,id=i,name=n})) |&gt; Dec.field ""attributes"" ```",0
1272,Winston,"So uhm, I just expanded a case of statement into 33 possible matches and now it takes about 3 minutes to compile",0
1272,Steffanie,"Yeah, the exhaustiveness checker goes a little crazy with large case of stmts. Should be much better in 0.19, tho",0
1272,Winston,make it ten,0
1272,Maximina,"I just discovered that elm treats this as a valid type signature: ""foo : List Int Bool -&gt; Int"". I don't understand how that's valid. I can understand ""foo: List Int -&gt; Int"", but I don't understand why ""Bool"" is allowed in this context when it's not a separate argument.

1273,Hallie,Caitlin: Thanks!,0
1274,Windy,"I have a json string I need to decode. It's complex enough (in my mind, anyway) that I don't understand how to use Json.Decode with it to break it down into an Elm model. Its structure is something like this: ```{playerNames: [""Fred"", ""Barney""], games: [{date: ""May 20"", stats: [{ab:2, hits: 1}, {ab: 3, hits: 0}]}, {date: ""May 27"", stats: [{ab: 1, hits: 1}, {ab: 3, hits: 1}]} ]}``` I'm not sure how to begin to decode this. Can I use Json.Decode on its own or should I use the elm-decode-pipeline package, or something else?",0
1274,Charlyn,Windy: you can use Json.Decode on it's own. When writing a Json decoder start by writing a decoders for the child nodes and compose those together to create decoders for the parent nodes,0
1274,Charlyn,"eg. start by making a decoder for `{ab:2, hits: 1}`",0
1274,Windy,"Charlyn: So begin with my records? Yes, okay. Then how do I use the result of that with its parent?",0
1274,Charlyn,"once you have a decoder for `{ab:2, hits: 1}` you can pass that decoder to <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/5.1.1/Json-Decode#list> and get a decoder that decoders lists of `{ab:2, hits: 1}`",0
1274,Windy,"Okay, sounds good. Let me give it a whirl. Thank you.",0
1274,Charlyn,Windy: note that what you pasted above isn't valid json since the field names need to be quoted,0
1274,Windy,"Yes, you're right. I was short-cutting it with my representation. I do have valid json with quotes in the right places.",0
1274,Charlyn,"alrighty, I just didn't want you to get frustrated trying to write a parser for invalid json",0
1274,Windy,"Thanks for that. Here's the actual json I'm working with: ```{""playerNames"":[""Fred"",""Barney""],""games"":[{""date"":""May 20"",""stats"":[{""ab"":2,""hits"":2},{""ab"":2,""hits"":1}]},{""date"":""June 3"",""stats"":[{""ab"":2,""hits"":2},{""ab"":3,""hits"":3}]},{""date"":""June 4"",""stats"":[{""ab"":2,""hits"":2},{""ab"":2,""hits"":2}]},{""date"":""June 10"",""stats"":[{""ab"":2,""hits"":2},{""ab"":2,""hits"":0}]},{""date"":""June 17"",""stats"":[{""ab"":2,""hits"":2},{""ab"":3,""hits"":2}]},{""date"":""June 19"",""stats"":[{""ab"":0,""hits"":0},{""ab"":4,""hits"":4}]},{""date"":""June 20"",""stats"":[{""ab"":2,""hits"":2},{""ab"":0,""hits"":0}]}]}```",0
1274,Charlyn,You can also paste that in to <http://eeue56.github.io/json-to-elm/> and you'll get a generated parser. But it's good to write one yourself when learning so you actually understand how it works.,0
1274,Windy,"No doubt. If I'm pulling my hair out over writing my own after a couple days, maybe I'll resort to that. Thanks for the link.",0
1274,Windy,"I wrote the encoder piece fine on my own, so you'd think I'd get this decoder stuff better than I do!",0
1274,Charlyn,"it's good for pasting in small bits of json, eg. paste in just `{""ab"":2,""hits"":2}`",0
1274,Windy,"Yeah, that makes sense. I'm brand new to functional programming, and so I'm still shifting my mind a bit.",0
1274,Windy,How can I convert a list of 2 strings into a tuple?,0
1274,Caitlin,Windy: `List.map2`: <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/latest/List#map2>,0
1274,Caitlin,Or `List.Extra.zip`: <https://klaftertief.github.io/elm-search/?q=List%20a%20-%3E%20List%20b%20-%3E%20List%20(a%2C%20b)>,0
1274,Windy,"Caitlin: Doesn't `List.map2` give another List back? I want [""apples, ""grapes""] to become (""apples"", ""grapes""). What am I missing? Maybe I'm up too late at night. Sorry if this is obvious.",0
1274,Windy,(apples and grapes are unknown strings at compile time in my case),0
1274,Caitlin,"Ah sorry, I read 2 lists, not list of 2",0
1274,Caitlin,"Really you're list of 2 should be a tuple the whole time, otherwise you'll have to return a `Maybe (String, String)` instead, but you write a function that uses a `case ... of ...` to match `x1 :: x2 :: []` which is a list of 2 items. Return a `Just` for that and `Nothing` for all other cases(you can use `_ -&gt; ` after the 2 item pattern to match everything else).",0
1274,Windy,"Hmmm. I've got a json string which comes in as a list of two strings, but my model represents those things as a tuple. Okay, let me try what you're suggesting.",0
1274,Caitlin,"If you're starting with a list because of JSON decoding, you should be able to skip the list using something like `Decode.map2 (,)` along with `Decode.index`.",0
1274,Windy,"Oh! That'll be much better, yes.",0
1274,Windy,I feel like my model should have represented these things as a 2-item List to start with. Not sure I'm buying much by having these stored in a tuple.,0
1274,Caitlin,"A tuple gives you a guarantee about the number of items. With a list you'll find you'll have to handle cases of empty lists, 1-item lists, &amp; 3+ item lists as well as the 2-item list",0
1274,Caitlin,"Like that function above would be: ``` listToTuple list = case list of x1 :: x2 :: [] -&gt; Just (x1, x2) _ -&gt; Nothing ``` If you'll be pulling the values out of the list often, you'll probably have to repeat the above a lot, or handle a lot of `Maybe`s",0
1274,Windy,Thank you for the help. I'll give it a shot tomorrow.,0
1275,Brain,"jonf: We should have a numpy like converntion. in scipy/numpy you always import a bunch of common modules using accepted aliases, so it makes examples lot terser. if I see np, I know you have done `import numpy as np`, and I need not ask what is `np`.",0

1276,Cortney,"Do you see the ""tab"" on the bottom right of the page?",0
1276,Cortney,Or does it fail to expand when you click the tab?,0
1276,Elodia,the tab is missing! it was there at some point (expanded and in tab form) but now even after recompiling/restarting computer it does not shop up anymore. application works still fine (sorry for late answer),0
1276,Long,Have you tried running `elm-reactor` from the command line?,0
1276,Cortney,The tab is a div abs. positioned in the page so it might happens that it plays badly with other elements.,0
1276,Cortney,Check if you have other page elements which overlaps with the tab.,0

1278,Lynwood,How do I get the size and position of placed DOM elements?,0
1278,Ok,Lynwood: i have the feeling think we can't get that just in elm. i'm still learning :smile:,0
1278,Larissa,&gt; How do I get the size and position of placed DOM elements? If you have your model with properties for position and size you can always take control of it,0
1278,Ok,that's true!,0
1278,Ok,"but cannot get it of a rendered DOM element, right?",0
1278,Larissa,Elm does not have direct access to DOM,0
1278,Larissa,"So if you can design to use your model for it, it’s the way to go. If not then you can use JS with ports.",0
1278,Lynwood,"I don't want to implement my own flow, I would like the browser to do it. As in, I don't want to decide myself the position and size of the elements, but get the size after the fact",0
1278,Lynwood,"Okidokies, thanks for your help",0
1278,Larissa,Lynwood: what’s your case by the way?,0
1278,Lynwood,I would like to draw arrows between elements,0
1278,Lynwood,such as from and to centers of two DOM nodes,0
1278,Hung,"You can do this using port. Write a port like `findDimension : String -&gt; Cmd msg` where you can pass a selector. Then have something like `elementDimension : ({ r | selector : String, dimensions : Dimensions } -&gt; msg) -&gt; Sub msg` that the javascript can provide the dimensions.",0
1278,Hung,"Alternatively, if you are doing this in reaction to a click on an element, for example, you can probably decode the dimensions from the event using `on`",0
1278,Larissa,Lynwood: And can you achieve positioning with css?,0
1278,Lynwood,Larissa: Yes,0
1278,Lynwood,Hung: Thanks. That looks like a good start.,0

1281,Eryn,"Hi! My project is based on reading information off a local JSON file. I can then update the data from the browser, what can I do to save it back to JSON (I'm not asking about JSON.Encode but rather about how to save to an external file)? Do I need to use `port`?",0
1281,Terrie,Eryn: elm is compiled into JS and this is executed into the client browser. The browser does not have access to write into the server file system. You will need a backend for that.,0
1281,Eryn,"Terrie: Oh yes I had forgotten about that… I guess whatever memory I want to last would need this. I guess I should make a little program than runs in parallel, listening on a socket or something? Thanks.",0
1281,Jewel,"If you want to store information in the browser, you can use LocalStorage (via a port)",0
1281,Jewel,depends on what you want to store really,0
1281,Eryn,Basically I have a tree that I manipulate and want to save even after I close my browser (I don't want it to be save in the browser memory).,0
1281,Jewel,"yes, so you could either use LocalStorage, which will store it on disk locally, but will be restricted to that particular computer/browser, or you need a server",0
1281,Lynwood,"Can I get elm-reactor to refresh the site when saving the file? Even better, can I get it to do hot module reload? (I.e. maintain the state)",0
1281,Steffanie,`elm-live` has at least one of those features,0
1281,Eryn,"Jewel: Right , thanks. I think I'll make a server on the side. And then use websocket / port?",0
1281,Jewel,"Well, if you have a simple REST service you’d just use the <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/http/latest> package",0
1282,Alyce,Hi does anyone know how I can encode a set to a JSON list object?,0
1282,Alyce,I tried: Encode.list &lt;| Set.map Encode.string formData.objectives,0
1282,Jewel,"Alyce: , just use `Set.toList` first",0
1282,Eryn,Jewel: Oh right. I'm still not familiar with what you can and cannot do.,0
1282,Eryn,Thanks,0
1282,Lynwood,Steffanie: thanks!,0
1282,Alyce,Jewel: do you mean: Encode.list &lt;| List.map Encode.string &lt;| Set.toList formData.threat_objectives_at_stake,0
1282,Jewel,looks right,0
1282,Alyce,Ok thanks a lot,0
1283,Doria,Lynwood: <https://github.com/fluxxu/elm-hot-loader> maintains state too :smile:,0
1283,Pamila,"perhaps, but unlike in python the compiler enforces it. You also don't get ancestor imports either. I suspect it's less of an issue.",0
1283,Fatimah,Doria: Lynwood: I also used this <https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-elm-app> which packages up the elm-hot-loader mentioned by,0
1284,Isidro,"Tanner: Hi , I have a quick question about the SPA Conduit App that you shared a few weeks back. Is this the appropriate forum in which to ask it?",0
1284,Isidro,"In your comments for the Main.elm file, you say that the majority of the code in that file will go away in 0.19. I've found that as I've built my app (based on your work), that Main.elm is getting bigger. I'm anxious that based on your comment that I'm moving in the wrong direction. so, when you say that Main.elm will largely go away what does that actually mean?",0
1284,Isidro,(I guess I'll just ask the question here :slightly_smiling_face: ),0
1284,Isidro,"The comment in question was this: ``` -- WARNING: this whole file will become unnecessary and go away in Elm 0.19, -- so avoid putting things in here unless there is no alternative! ```",0
1284,Tanner,Evan is working on a design for code splitting that would mean each page has its own entry point,0
1284,Tanner,"that may get pushed back to the release after 0.19 in order to let 0.19 ship sooner, so I may end up regretting saying 0.19 specifically :sweat_smile:",0
1284,Tanner,"point being, avoid putting logic in there",0
1284,Tanner,because it'll inevitably end up getting moved somewhere else when that file goes away,0
1284,Tanner,"if all you're doing is things like expanding on the existing case-expressions in there, that's :thumbsup:",0
1284,Isidro,"Tanner: Thanks . My file is getting bigger to handle more case-expressions, so that's reassuring. Also, any indication as to when 0.19 might land :grin:",0
1285,Hallie,"Hello! Does anyone have an example of a search/autocomplete for an input field of a select2. I am looking for something somewhat similar to <https://github.com/evancz/elm-sortable-table/> , but in a select2 instead of a table.",0
1285,Velma,Hallie: this may be close to what you're looking for: <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/sporto/elm-select/latest>,0
1285,Hallie,"Velma: Thanks, I will take a look",0
1285,Velma,I haven't used it myself but the examples on the demo site look kind of like select2 <https://sporto.github.io/elm-select/>,0
1285,Hallie,"Velma: This is not quite what I need. I need something where you can also see the choices you'd like to select from, not just an autocomplete field. You want the ability to see the content and also the ability to auto-complete. something like this <https://screencast.com/t/qsn74lvauf>",0
1285,Velma,It looks like this is closer: <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/sporto/elm-dropdown/latest>,0
1285,Velma,"(BTW, I'm getting these by searching for ""dropdown"" and ""select"" on <http://package.elm-lang.org/>. There are several libraries that there that might also fulfill your need)",0
1285,Hallie,"Velma: Yes, that is what I am looking for. Thanks again.",0
1285,Hallie,"Velma: after all, it is not what I am looking for, this one is just a select, the other one is just an auto-complete field, I am looking for something that does both. I will do as you suggested (searching more in <http://package.elm-lang.org/>.",0
1285,Hallie,Haven't been successful at finding something that could be used both as select and auto-complete :disappointed:,0
1285,Eleanor,"Do you mean you want the list to open with all the options without typing but that you can ""filter"" it by typing something?",0
1285,Steffanie,"yeah, I think a basic select2 type thing (<https://select2.github.io/examples.html>)",0
1285,Steffanie,I think both `elm-searchable-menu` and `elm-autocomplete` support such behaviour,0
1285,Eleanor,"Hmm, I suppose that is useful with some sort of data. We used this in our case (choosing the user's town of residence), but with a cursory look it doesn't look like you can make the dropdown open just by clicking the input. <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/thebritican/elm-autocomplete/latest>",0
1286,Yulanda,Hi! What's the best way to control the selected option of a `select`? I want to set it from the model :thinking_face:,1
1286,Esmeralda,Yulanda: that's done with the `selected` attribute <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/html/2.0.0/Html-Attributes#selected>,0
1286,Esmeralda,so typically you might do something like `List.map (\item -&gt; option [ selected (item == model.activeItem)] [ {- some html -} ]) allItems` in your view,0
1286,Yulanda,"I see, thanks",0
1287,Judie,"hi guys, I’m sure I’m missing something really obvious but I can’t figure out how to invert the boolean condition in this filter statement: `List.filter (String.startsWith ""0"")`",0
1287,Velma,"`List.filter not &lt;&lt; (String.startsWith ""0"")`",0
1287,Judie,"ah, I was using `&lt;|` instead",0
1287,Judie,doh :slightly_smiling_face:,0
1287,Judie,cheers,0
1287,Velma,"Quick rule of thumb, if the result needs to be a function, you probably want `&lt;&lt;`",0
1287,Velma,"You can always combine manually using a lambda too: `List.filter (\n -&gt; not (String.startsWith ""0"" n))`",0
1287,Velma,I'll often start with the lambda to get a feel for what I'm doing before refactoring to a `&lt;&lt;` implementation,0
1287,Judie,"makes sense, and good advice - cheers",0
1287,Judie,"since I’ve got someone who’s obviously a few ElmFu belts ahead of me - is there a better way of writing something like this: ``` hexToDec : String -&gt; Maybe Int hexToDec hex = String.split """" hex |&gt; List.map hexCharToDec |&gt; \decimals -&gt; if List.any isNothing decimals then Nothing else List.map (withDefault 0) decimals |&gt; List.reverse |&gt; List.indexedMap toActualValue |&gt; List.sum |&gt; Just ``` ??",0
1287,Miguel,@dans <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/rtfeldman/hex/1.0.0/Hex#fromString> ?,0
1287,Hallie,"Eleanor: Sorry for the delay, yes, I need something that opens a list with all options without typing and something that I can also filter it by typing.",0
1287,Miguel,"Judie: er,",0
1287,Judie,"Miguel: I was doing it as a learning exercise, figured it was a solved problem but seemed like an interesting one to solve again",0
1287,Miguel,"Well, then: <https://github.com/rtfeldman/hex/blob/1.0.0/src/Hex.elm#L14>",0
1287,Velma,"In your implementation, I would probably try a combination of `List.foldl` and `Maybe.andThen` rather than the conditional + `List.map` + `List.sum`",0
1287,Judie,"cheers, I’ll have a look into the `andThen` function",0
1287,Velma,"Actually, summing Maybes should be done with `Maybe.map2 (+)`, not `Maybe.andThen`",0
1287,Velma,``` sumMaybes : List (Maybe Int) -&gt; Maybe Int sumMaybes digits = List.foldl (Maybe.map2 (+)) (Just 0) digits ```,0
1287,Judie,"Velma: yep, that works - I had to change my `toActualValue` function to handle Maybes but after that I was able to just use your `sumMaybes`",0
1287,Miguel,Judie: The original `toActualValue` was `Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Int`? You should be able to go `Maybe.map &lt;&lt; toActualValue`,0
1287,Judie,"I should ask more questions in this channel, getting lots of good suggestions :slightly_smiling_face:",0
1287,Judie,in this case though I tried that and I think the function is cleaner moving the Maybe.map inside the `toActualValue` function,0
1287,Miguel,"I would suggest against that. If you want to clean it up, make another helper function to give it a cleaner name.",0
1287,Judie,"the function name for `toActualValue` is a bit rubbish though, I know :slightly_smiling_face:",0
1287,Miguel,"Regardless of that, you are mixing concerns by having it deal with `Maybe`. It's good practice to write the function that doesn't need to know about how to take the `Maybe` apart and then inject that information using `map` or `andThen`",0
1287,Miguel,"Also, I think that you can go `Bitwise.shiftLeftBy &lt;&lt; (*) 4` to raise something to the appropriate power.",0
1287,Judie,that makes sense,0
1287,Pamila,instead of indexed map I'd probably use a fold there,0
1287,Pamila,"`foldr (\v (p,a) -&gt; (p*16,a+p*v)) (1,0) digits`",0
1287,Pamila,likewise a maybe list function can be constructed ``` maybeList: List (Maybe a) -&gt; Maybe (List a) maybeList l = let mapped = List.filterMap identity in if List.length mapped = List.length l then Just mapped else Nothing ```,0
1287,Judie,"so you’re suggesting something like: ``` hexToDec : String -&gt; Maybe Int hexToDec hex = String.split """" hex |&gt; List.map hexCharToDec |&gt; maybeList |&gt; (Maybe.map &lt;&lt; Tuple.second &lt;&lt; foldr (\v (p,a) -&gt; (p*16,a+p*v)) (1,0)) ``` ?",0
1287,Pamila,"it would do the thing, I'd probably split out the `Tuple.second &lt;&lt; foldr` into a named function because it's a bit dense and give it a nice name",0
1287,Pamila,accumlate list,0
1287,Pamila,or have it be accumulateWithStride and have the 16 come in as a parameter,0
1287,Pamila,The only thing not specified would be what happens to the empty list,0
1287,Miguel,I think I would like `sumDigits : Int -&gt; List Int -&gt; Int` better.,0
1287,Miguel,But names are hard.,0
1287,Judie,just trying to test it out as I’m not convinced it does actually solve it (I think it might miss the case when you don’t multiply by a power at all for the first hex digit) - getting: ``` the argument to function `length` is causing a mismatch. 120| List.length mapped ^^^^^^ Function `length` is expecting the argument to be: List b But it is: List (Maybe b) -&gt; List b ``` for the maybeList function - and I’m too tired to figure out whats up myself :slightly_smiling_face:,0
1287,Pamila,ahh the line should be `List.filterMap identity l`,0
1287,Pamila,my bad,0
1287,Pamila,"well the first digit should be multplied by one, the second by 16 and so on",0
1287,Judie,"ah, of course",0
1287,Pamila,the one thing it does to would be return 0 for an empty list as opposed to say Nothing,0
1287,Miguel,How about ``` maybeList : List (Maybe a) -&gt; Maybe (List a) maybeList = List.foldr (Maybe.map2 (::)) (Just []) ```,0
1287,Pamila,"hmm, yes I think that would do what you want",0
1287,Judie,"cheers guys, been interesting working through this with you - my understanding of how to handle Maybe’s has definitely come along this evening!",0
1287,Pamila,"no problem, and good luck",0
1287,Pamila,in your further learnins for great profit,0
1287,Judie,"last one for you, for the road: ``` maybeTuple3 : ( Maybe a, Maybe b, Maybe c ) -&gt; Maybe ( a, b, c ) maybeTuple3 tuple = case tuple of ( Just a, Just b, Just c ) -&gt; Just ( a, b, c ) _ -&gt; Nothing ``` Trying to figure out how to do this with a Maybe.mapX",0
1287,Pamila,I think you probably want curry3 or something like that,0
1287,Pamila,mmm there is only curry and uncurry no uncurry 3,0
1287,Pamila,"but perhaps you could write it ``` uncurry3 : (a -&gt; b -&gt; c -&gt; d) -&gt; (a,b,c) -&gt; d uncurry3 f (a,b,c) = f a b c ```",0
1287,Pamila,"then it would go together something like `maybeTuple3 = uncurry3 (Maybe.map3 (,,))`",0
1287,Pamila,"I think, this is me coding without checking if it compiles",0
1287,Judie,"this works : ``` maybeTuple3 : ( Maybe a, Maybe b, Maybe c ) -&gt; Maybe ( a, b, c ) maybeTuple3 ( a, b, c ) = Maybe.map3 (,,) a b c ```",0
1287,Judie,"I didn’t realise you could do the (,,) thing",0
1287,Pamila,well there you go,0

1288,Rubie,hello all,0
1288,Rubie,i am just starting to learn elm,0
1288,Rubie,and i follow the official guide and try to add helpers to my form,0
1288,Rubie,what can i do for checking a type of a var?,0
1288,Rubie,<https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/user_input/forms.html>,0
1288,Rubie,Add an additional field for age and check that it is a number.,0
1288,Rubie,i am trying to doing that,0
1288,Rubie,but no idea and dont find doc about that,0
1288,Pamila,"well it's going to be handed back as a string, so attempting to convert it to an in will fail if its not a valid int",0
1288,Pamila,Look in the strings package,0
1288,Rubie,using toString ?,0
1288,Tabitha,`String.toInt` ?,0
1288,Pamila,right and its going to give you a Result which is either a valid Int or an error,0
1288,Tabitha,<http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/5.1.1/String#toInt>,0
1288,Pamila,you need to handle both the case where it succeeds as well as when it fails.,0
1288,Tabitha,<https://guide.elm-lang.org/error_handling/result.html>,0
1288,Rubie,wow not really clear,0
1288,Rubie,how to get the Err value,0
1288,Pamila,"Tabitha: it's an algebraic data type or union type, the link gave shows how you extract the types with a case statement",0
1288,Pamila,"well, one way to extract the info",0
1288,Tabitha,"``` case String.toInt userInputAge of Err thisIsTheErrorValue -&gt; span [class ""error""] [text thisIsTheErrorValue] Ok age -&gt; ... more html ```",0
1288,Rubie,"``` isConvertible : String -&gt; Html msg isConvertible t = let (color, message) = case String.toInt t of Err msg -&gt; (""red"", ""not a number"") Ok age -&gt; (""green"", ""OK"") in div [ style [(""color"", color)] ] [ text message ] ```",0
1288,Rubie,its working but maybe its better to do a function ?,0
1288,Rubie,that return true or false?,0
1288,Pamila,Rubie: I would put either the result in your model or convert it to a maybe type and store that.,0
1288,Tabitha,"Rubie: rather one that returns `(String,String)`",0
1288,Pamila,"Rubie: err, nvm you need to set the field with the string value. Yeah you could probably refactor that code into something that returns a list of validation errors and then renders the list or shows ok if now validation errors are present",0

1290,Hallie,"Hi again. Would anyone be willing to take a look at this program <https://ellie-app.com/3xJW7xbNLJZa1/2> and give me suggestions on how to make the select also auto-complete? I have a select element and an input field below, the input field auto-completes, I would like the select to also do auto-complete. In other words, I need something that opens a list with all options without typing, but that can also filter by typing. (The example is a simplified version of the example in <https://github.com/SimplyNaOH/elm-searchable-menu/blob/master/examples/src/Example.elm>) where I added the select element)",0
1290,Hallie,What I am trying to do is something like select2 in Elm <https://select2.github.io/examples.html>,0
1290,Hallie,My only option might be to talk to Javascript.,0
1290,Hallie,We are transitioning from Rails to Elm. I am unsure how to reproduce what we got with select2 through JQuery Does anyone have advice on how to go about it?,0
1290,Gerard,From Rails to Elm? The whole app or just the front end?,0
1290,Hallie,just the front end,0
1290,Gerard,"Gotcha. I think for what you want you're gonna need some custom code, probably a port at some point.",0
1290,Gerard,"I'm looking over what you have, and, without diving into it entirely (so I could be wrong), it looks like you have a lot of what you want and it may be more of a styling issue at this point.",0
1290,Hallie,Gerard: I don't seem to be able to put the 2 together though,0
1290,Hallie,"I am pretty new with Elm, as you can probably tell. Do you know if there a way to use a JQuery library through the ports?",0
1290,Gerard,"You can use JQuery libraries through ports, but I'd advice against it if possible. It gets messy quick.",0
1290,Hallie,Gerard: ok. Thanks,0
1291,Hiram,"hello. I'm new to elm, and was wondering about the ""time traveling"" debugging. This feature is possible because in the elm runtime there is a single message bus through which all events are serialized?",0
1291,Pamila,more because there is a single well defined state,0
1291,Pamila,in general it's due to lack of side effects in code. meaning I can simply log cmds and state and replay it backwards and forwards,0
1291,Hiram,Pamila: hi . cmds are consumed by the elm runtime?,0
1291,Pamila,indeed they are,0
1291,Pamila,Which it in turn uses to generate a stream of messages for your update function,0
1291,Hiram,"ah thanks. Stream of messages terminology is relatable to me, coming from js world",0
1291,Hiram,and the elm compiler checks that each possible message maps to an update function,0
1291,Pamila,"mm, there is only a single update function, but it checks that the update function handles all possible messages",0
1291,Hiram,ah thanks,0
1292,Lea,Is it considered bad style to create a type with a single constructor wrapping a record? The down side is that you have to pattern match the constructor to get at the record in order to use dot notation. The up side is the strong nominal typing guarantee.,1
1292,Lea,"E.g. `type Foo = Foo { x : Int, y : Int }`",0
1292,Lea,I guess Evan also pointed out that wrapping the record can be used to hide the representation from library users. I probably have no need for that in my case.,0
1292,Dyan,"Lea: I would not consider it bad style at all. In our application we tried to do that as much as possible where it made sense, for the reason you described. Elm has great pattern matching, so it's very easy to access said fields in a function definition, etc. E.g ``` myFunc (Foo {x, y}) = x + y ```",0
1292,Dyan,"If I recall correctly, you don't need the parentheses if you only have one argument",0
1292,Dyan,"And if you need to reference the entire value again, you can use the `as` keyword: ``` myFunc (Foo {x, y} as fooValue) = ... ```",0
1292,Lea,"Good point, thanks. I have been accessing the record via: ``` myFunc (Foo foo) = foo.x + foo.y ``` ...so that's another option. What's tricky is if you have a list of foos and you want to map an accessor over them.",0
1292,Charlyn,Lea: The common pattern for that is to define a `map` function for your type that applies functions to the unwrapped record value,0
1292,Lea,"That makes total sense, considering it's a separate type, and Elm likes to keep its map functions clearly distinct.",0
1293,Lynwood,Fatimah: Doria: thanks for the heads-up about fluxxu's elm-hot-loader and create-elm-app,0
1293,Fatimah,"Lynwood: No problem I was at a Meetup and some ClojureScript people were talking about how cool ClojureScript is at hot code reloading. Elm is not at that level, but with the hot loader, it is close enough.",0
1294,Eleanor,The classical JS solution is to make a click handler that closes it for the entire page behind the dropdown.,0
1294,Jewel,"Eleanor: but not for clicks in the input field, right? I wonder how to best do that in Elm",0
1294,Doria,"oscarevert: The way I've done it: Keep track of the rect for your input/dropdown (i.e in your model), you could use something like <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/debois/elm-dom/1.2.3/DOM#boundingClientRect>) and then set up a subscription to <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/mouse/1.0.1/Mouse#clicks> to check for clicks outside your input/dropdown",0
1295,Nova,"I'm building a filterable list of events and I'm wondering if I'm on the right track: <https://ellie-app.com/3xVrLFYmdnra1/3> Specifically: 1. As `EventType` is a union type, how can I filter the list of events on e.g. `Birthday` without taking it's extra `Int` parameter (age) into account? 2. When I pass `Birthday` as the `EventType` to the `SetTypeFilter` message, I need to pass in an extra value for the age as well. Would there be a better way to do this?",0
1295,Eleanor,"Yeah, this seems odd and could lead to bugs: `(\_ -&gt; SetTypeFilter (Birthday 0))`",0
1295,Eleanor,What do the numbers represent in the types?,0
1295,Nova,"with Birthday it's the age he/she will reach, with Employment it's the work anniversary (e.g. working for 5 years at the company), with Marriage it's the wedding anniversary (e.g. being married for 10 years)",0
1295,Eleanor,"oooh, okay",0
1295,Nova,"I use these in the rendering, e.g. ""2017-06-21 It's the birthday of Pete Promo, becoming 42 years old""",0
1295,Nova,"Since the numbers belong to the event type, I figured using a union type.",0
1295,Eleanor,"Hmm, this makes me feel like putting a function in the SetTypeFilter message, but that's never a good solution (and it also makes the debugger not work)...",0
1295,Eleanor,There's probably an easier modeling of this problem.,0
1295,Nova,"I could place the numbers in a separate property on the Event, e.g. `payload: Maybe Int`? Then the EventType union type doesn't need the extra parameter.",0
1295,Eleanor,"I have an idea that would work rather nicely, but involves understanding extensible records. Your idea works too, and it's not bad at all.",0
1295,Eleanor,"I'll update the Ellie to the idea that I have just as a reference, in case you're interested",0
1295,Nova,"really? wow, thanks! :raised_hands:",0
1295,Jewel,"A simple option is to have a separate union type for filters, like `BirthdayFilter` etc, and then have a filter function that does `case` on that type. More boilerplate, but type safe",0
1295,Nova,How would the filter function work then?,0
1295,Eleanor,"Yeah, the idea that I had is actually much more cumbersome in code than I thought it would be, so let's scratch that. :slightly_smiling_face:",0
1295,Jewel,"So, I’d do like this (but this is just a preference) ``` filterEvent filter event = case (filter, event) of (ActiveFilter, Active) -&gt; True (ActiveFilter, _) -&gt; False (BirthdayFilter, Birthday _) -&gt; True (BirthdayFilter, _) -&gt; False ... ``` I generally do it like this so I don’t have to have a “catch all”",0
1295,Jewel,"or the arguments in the other order, maybe, for your usage of the filter",0
1295,Nova,"`event` would be the `eventType` property of the event record, I guess?",0
1295,Jewel,another option is to do it like this ``` filterEvent filterList event = case event of Active -&gt; List.member ActiveFilter filterList Birthday _ -&gt; List.member BirthdayFilter filterList ... ``` sorry if I’ve not understood your problem correctly,0
1295,Nova,ohanhi: Thanks anyway!,0
1295,Nova,"nice, that would support multiple filters as well. Thanks a lot!",0
1295,Jewel,"Generally I find that making specific types pay off in simplicity and type safety, even if it leads to more code",0
1295,Jewel,you’re welcome!,0
1295,Jewel,"you could of course break it out to make a function `: Event -&gt; EventFilter` and make that `filterEvent` function more general, it’s just refactoring at that point",0
1295,Nova,"Sorry, I don't understand what you mean by that? :slightly_smiling_face:",0
1295,Jewel,"so, you’d make something like ``` eventFilterFor : Event -&gt; EventFilter eventFilterFor event = case event of Active -&gt; ActiveFilter Birthday _ -&gt; BirthdayFilter ... ``` it depends on how complicated your filters should be, the previous solution allows for different kind of filtering based on the event. So it’s refactoring/preference/etc",0
1295,Nova,"ah, I see. That would be useful when filtering is done in multiple places, I think.",0
1296,Sherrell,"Hi there! So I've been working on a project that, at some point, navigates to a page that communicates with the server using a websocket. This is to get live updates of the results from the server (it's performing a task). I'm experiencing a problem with this: - When using Elm Navigation, if the route and its query parameters are the same, it does not trigger the update msg that I implemented (which sends a GET request to the server asking for previous results, which works fine). It does, however, trigger upon switching routes (editing the query parameter back and forth or simply navigating to a different page) so I assume that Navigation does not attempt to perform the specified actions if the conditions are the same, even if it's a refresh request.",0

So I can just call them without passing language around.",0
1297,Willard,"I'm not sure I understood what you want, but if you do something like `let en_title = title En in ...` you can use the `en_title` var wherever a `String` is allowed",0

1297,Hilaria,"I think hes asking how he can use `Lang`, but without a case statement at the lowest level of all his html.",0
1297,Hilaria,Right?,0
1297,Larissa,The question is how I can use translation functions without passing language into them,0
1297,Larissa,"in `elm-css-helpers` I can do like this ``` { id, class, classList } = Html.CssHelpers.withNamespace ""dreamwriter"" ```",0
1297,Larissa,so whenever I use those functions they will be called with given prefix,0
1297,Miguel,"I'm not aware of a simple, out-of-the-box way of avoiding passing *something* around. It sounds like figuring out how to wrap things in `State` would work, but that's a rather advanced topic.",0

1297,Willard,"This is an invertion of control: instead of the functions defining their data (by pattern matching on the lang etc.), you pass the content to them and let them handle only the structure",0
1297,Willard,That way you can have all translations in one object and pass to the functions only the content they need,0
1297,Willard,"You can alternatively have a lower level of abstraction and instead of taking the translation plus a getter, you can take the content directly.",0
1297,Willard,"Larissa: Does it help, ?",0
1297,Jewel,Larissa: also look at <https://youtu.be/RcHV6R-Jq00> if you haven't already,0

1299,Willard,"BTW, why don't we have user-defined typeclasses or at least user-defined instances of typeclasses? I this a design choice? Or it's in the roadmap but wasn't made yet?",0
1299,Pamila,Elm is designed to be a simple language,0
1299,Pamila,custom typeclasses add alot of complexity,0
1299,Pamila,"although I would say the problem with haskell is not typeclasses, but user-defined operator madness",0
1299,Jewel,"Also, error messages are harder to understand with type classes",0
1299,Jewel,And the philosophy of Elm seems to be to not introduce anything unless there is a really compelling use case for it that can’t be solved otherwis,0
1299,Hilaria,"Ive studied enough Haskell to understand what a type class _is_, but when are they actually _useful_?",0
1299,Hilaria,I never figured that one out.,0
1299,Willard,Hmmm for me the problema with haskell is akin to the problem with JS: a few bad decisions in that past that are dragged indefinitely into the future.,0
1299,Velma,you can have functions that take more abstract parameters,0
1299,Velma,"for example, a single `map` implementation",0
1299,Jewel,"Elm has built-in typeclasses, like `comparable` and `number`.",0
1299,Velma,I feel like union types not being `comparable` is probably the biggest typeclass-related annoyance,0
1299,Jewel,"joelq: although it would not be a single implementation for map, still one implementation per type. the benefits of type classes is when you combine them together to build hierarchies of them",0
1299,Geraldo,"yeah, comparable and number are compiler-magic...",0
1299,Velma,a lot of other stuff is nice in theory but I haven't really felt the need for it yet,0

1299,Velma,correct,0
1299,Hilaria,Why would you want to make your own type class?,0
1299,Velma,"It's kind of like an ""interface"" in OO. Now you can make a function `foo` that accepts any data structure that implements `map` for example instead of hard coding to a single type",0
1299,Geraldo,to be able to better model your business data structure?,0
1299,Willard,(and I feel the haskell community has somewhat of a too-great appetite for abstraction),0
1299,Jewel,to use typeclass-related syntax (for instance +) to use functions that are defined for a specific type class (like Set),0
1299,Hilaria,Any practical examples?,0
1299,Willard,"I don't feel much need int creating my own typeclasses, but I do sometimes feel we should be able at least to instantiate comparable for our own sum types",0

1301,Pamila,and you most definately don't side up with `f(x) = x + y` in math unless y is a constant,0

1301,Katie,"Let π = 3. Then π = 3. I have shadowed the variable π. Not good practice, but you can't say I'm wrong, because I just gave a definition for what I mean by π.",0
1301,Katie,"The only thing is that some variables have historical importance, and are used nearly universally in certain ways. But that's convention, not logic.",0
1301,Pamila,we coloquially refer to archimedes constant as pi because its frequent use as the symbol. But the constant itself doesn't change,0
1301,Katie,"A good example is something like γ, the Euler-Mascheroni constant. Surely γ is used in lots of ways, but it is also an important naturally-occurring number -- not all that different from π.",0
1301,Pamila,the concept of a fixed ratio between a diameter and a circumference that is the constant.,0
1301,Katie,"jonf: Just taking this aside, since it's not programming-related. But if you look at situations like multiple integrals, you can have ""constants"" which ""vary"" Like ∫∫xydxdy (taken over, say, a rectangle) which is equal to ∫y (∫xdx) dy. We say the variable y is constant with respect to x. It's treated as constant because when you zoom in on the inner integral ""∫xydx"", you can see the quantifier for x (the ""dx"" in a sense brings the variable x into existence), but you can't see the quantifier for y until you zoom back out.",0
1301,Pamila,"y isn't a constant in that scenario it is a variable of the inner function f(y,x)=xy you are simply recoginizing that there exists an identity g(y) = ∫xydx = y * ∫xdx",0
1301,Katie,"Right. But that requires a global perspective. Locally, (when you confine your analysis to just the inner scope) it acts in all ways exactly like a constant.",0
1301,Katie,"The perspective I'm arguing here is useful if you're, say, writing a compiler, and you want to concern yourself with local data whenever possible.",0
1301,Katie,"But ultimately, you can take different perspectives on it.",0

1304,Cassaundra,Hi all :slightly_smiling_face:,0
1304,Cassaundra,I'm looking into frontend stuff and I was wondering if I could get an opinion -,0
1304,Cassaundra,"I'm building a webapp with rails, and I'm looking towards frontend. In the past I've used pure JS (which can be a pain). I've been experimenting with React, and while it's cool, I feel like it's a bit overkill (not to mention if the end-user doesn't enable JS, the whole page breaks). I was looking into integrating elm with existing HTML (instead of replacing everything with elm), which seems to be possible with Elm embeds. However I'm a little confused as to how they interact. Can different elm embeds interact with each other? For instance, if I were to have a persistent audio player similar to the one on soundcloud, could I make that audio player an embed, but have multiple controls for that component in other embeds? Hopefully that makes sense...",1
1304,Yessenia,Cassaundra: Each embedded Elm app would be separate and they would need to communicate using ports just like they would have to if they were communicating with any other JS application. You will need a thin layer of JS in the middle that will coordinate the messages between the various Elm apps that you have. It is quite doable.,0
1304,Charlyn,Cassaundra: of course you can do the same thing with React,0
1304,Charlyn,I wouldn’t worry to much about people having JS disabled,0
1304,Cassaundra,Yessenia: would that solution still allow me to take advantage of stuff like subscriptions and models (like in the clock example)?,0
1304,Yessenia,"Cassaundra: Yes, standard Elm and in fact incoming ports will come via subscriptions.",0
1304,Cassaundra,do you happen to have any resources on that subject? I can't seem to find much of use but perhaps I'm looking in the wrong places/with the wrong keywords.,0
1304,Yessenia,Cassaundra: Are you talking about ports? I would start here if you haven't read this already: <https://guide.elm-lang.org/interop/javascript.html>,0
1304,Cassaundra,"Ah, thanks!",0
1305,Isabelle,"elm noob, so i have no idea... dropbox marketing page has this code: ``` window.addEventListener('click', function(event) { 'use strict'; for (var elm = event.target; elm; elm = elm.parentElement) { if (elm.id &amp;&amp; window._goch_.hasOwnProperty(elm.id) &amp;&amp; window._goch_[elm.id].call(elm, event) === false) { event.preventDefault(); } } }, true); ```",0
1305,Isabelle,is that an elm signature?,0
1305,Steffanie,"no, that's just `elm` as short for `element`",0
1305,Isabelle,"ha, ooops",0
1305,Steffanie,"yeah, their website is mostly react",0
1306,Judy,hey elmos,0
1306,Judy,I'm trying to understand this: ``` type alias Html msg = Node msg ``` from the Html package,0
1306,Judy,where does `Node` comes from?,0
1306,Steffanie,from the `VirtualDom` package,0
1306,Steffanie,"similarly, `type alias Svg msg = Node msg`. That is to say; they both use virtual-dom nodes under the hood :slightly_smiling_face:",0
1306,Judy,Oh I see,0
1306,Judy,but the documentation don't link Node with VirtualDom.Node,0
1306,Steffanie,"yeah, it's a little annoying that it doesn't do cross-package links",0
1306,Steffanie,I think there's a bug for it,0
1306,Judy,thanks so much,0
1306,Judy,"now, `type Node msg = Node`",0
1306,Judy,what is `msg` ?,0
1306,Steffanie,"That's because it uses Native. So basically, it's a combination of phantom types and native magic; through which you can save information in structures in an ""non-type-safe"" manner",0
1306,Steffanie,"`msg` in this case is a type variable for the message type that can be ""emitted"" from your dom-nodes through events",0
1306,Steffanie,"so you can do `onClick MyMsg` which is an `Attribute Msg` (because `MyMsg` is of type `Msg`). A dom node can have multiple attributes, and all of its children can have attributes, but they have to match types, so your final structure can only emit *one* type of events",0
1306,Judy,Steffanie: thanks !!,0
1307,Lovie,hi can someone advise on List mapping?,0
1307,Lovie,this is my code:,0
1307,Lovie,"updateVideo entry = if entry.ident == caption.ident then { entry | video = caption.video, status = “video” } else entry List.map updateVideo model.captions",0
1307,Lovie,and the error is,0
1307,Lovie,I ran into something unexpected when parsing your code! 134| List.map updateVideo model.captions ^ I am looking for one of the following things: an upper case name,0
1307,Lovie,Why does the compiler want an uppercase name?,0
1307,Steffanie,Lovie: I think you're missing a `let ... in` around that first part,0
1307,Lovie,Steffanie: that code is already nested in a let … in,0
1307,Lovie,can i nest again?,0
1307,Steffanie,"Eryn: the DOM (in your browser) keeps it own state. _Usually_ we'll make sure that the dom reflects our model by using `value model.something` in the view, but this in't always required (and actually, not always what you want)",0
1307,Lovie,"let b = “hasRecorded” newCaptions = caption :: model.captions updateVideo entry = if entry.ident == caption.ident then { entry | video = caption.video, status = “video” } else entry List.map updateVideo model.captions in ({ model | captions = newCaptions, debug = b }, Cmd.none)",0
1307,Steffanie,"hm, but where do you expect the result of that `List.map` to go?",0
1307,Lovie,Steffanie: i have a list and i want to update one element of that list,0

1307,Steffanie,maybe that's what you mean? or closer to it?,0
1307,Lovie,isn’t that the same? ie List.map still calling updateVideo?,0
1307,Lovie,i’ll try…,0
1307,Steffanie,"yeah, but now that expression is used, rather than just sitting there.",0
1307,Lovie,Steffanie: yep!,0
1307,Steffanie,"in a `let..in`, you have a place to declare values for use in the `in..` part. However, just an expression by itself doesn't do much, and isn't allowed there. You still have immutability, so just saying, imperatively ""change my values"", won't work :slightly_smiling_face:",0
1307,Lovie,thx! the silly variable was trying stuff out. This is the result:,0
1307,Lovie,"let b = “hasRecorded” updateVideo entry = if entry.ident == caption.ident then { entry | video = caption.video, status = “video” } else entry in ({ model | captions = List.map updateVideo model.captions, debug = b }, Cmd.none)",0

1307,Lovie,Steffanie: it works too. Is’n this a bit sily tho?,0
1307,Lovie,"({ model | captions = List.map updateVideo model.captions, debug = b },",0
1307,Lovie,"ie update the model, from the model?",0
1307,Steffanie,"I'm not sure what you mean by that. `update` returns a _new_ model, and _usually_ that's based on your previous state",0
1307,Steffanie,so using your previous model to build a new one makes perfect sense,0
1307,Lovie,Steffanie: a yes: immutabilty takes some getting used to,0
1307,Steffanie,"yeah, it's important to realize that `{ foo | v = ""val"" }` creates a _new_ record )",0
1307,Lovie,"Steffanie: thanks. I’m very happy with this slack channel, good help available :slightly_smiling_face:",0
1307,Katie,"It's not possible to include two .js files created by Elm on one page, is it?",0

1310,Pamila,well it looks like it can install things which the elm package manager can find,0

1310,Caitlin,"ports don't have to be in a separate module, but it's best as every port has the same namespace so a single module can help prevent name collisions.",0
1310,Pamila,umm I thought you needed a special `port module` declaration,0

1312,Mayola,"hello everyone, I hope you're all great. I would like to ask a general question about Elm ; I'm about to start learning and I'd like to know if I am doing the right choice (even though, considering how everyone trying Elm is in love with it, it must be the right choice at some point anyway :wink: ). So I have 2 questions, my first one is about learning Elm, and the other one is about what you can do once you are able to use it : first, what previous knowledge do you need to learn Elm ? I have an intermediate level in JS, HTML and CSS, and I'm going back to work after a year off so I might be a bit rusty. And then, once you are able to use Elm, what more do you need to learn, to be independant to build a web app? (When I say independant, I mean, by your own, you can build your app, back and front, of course you don't know everything and maybe you'll struggle and ask help on the way but you have the basic knowledge to do it, and to get the knowledge you miss on your way. Versus : some parts are totally obscure to you.) Is it like, what you will learn on your Elm way will teach you what you need to know ? Or do you need to add some back-end and database deep knowledge ? Well, sorry for the long message and thank you very much for your answers :slightly_smiling_face:",1
1312,Shawanda,"Unfortunately at this time you can’t use Elm on the backend, so if your application requires centralized data storage or business logic of some sort, you’ll still need to handle that separately.",0
1312,Mayola,"zgohr, and I've read some things about Elm using Node or compiling to Node or something with Node… it doesn't help?",0
1312,Shawanda,I haven’t looked into it so I’m not sure how viable it would be,0
1312,Mayola,"ok - and so, in other words, what can you exactly do with elm ?",0

1312,Mayola,"ok, thank you",0
1312,Shawanda,"Very generally, it replaces the use of javascript and html",0

1312,Mayola,"ok, I see",0
1312,Bryce,"Mayola: as for the first question, about previous knowledge... knowing **some** programming language helps, although it's probably not necessary :slightly_smiling_face: today I've heard my friends from one startup say that when they hire somebody to work on their Elm codebase, in two to three weeks he is fully ""caught up"".",0

1312,Mayola,this is still a bit abstract to me but I think I get the idea,0

1312,Mayola,"and I'd like to become independant, so I'm wondering what's the best way to follow (or if it's still too far from me) - i don't intend to be a superstar dev, right now just understanding the whole web app process and being able to do ""something"" with it",0
1312,Shawanda,"wish i could answer you better, it’s pretty hard to generalize about anything. I think it comes down to what your goals are with it",0
1312,Shawanda,A lot of us come from a javascript background and the preference for Elm comes from the distaste for javascript,0

1312,Ricki,Thanks very much! I'm looking into this now.,0
1312,Chanelle,Mayola: I think the job pool will be much smaller for Elm unfortunately.,0
1312,Chanelle,(Not sure if that's an important factor for you.),0
1312,Mayola,"Chanelle: , you're right. I don't really intend to work full time in a company, but I'd like to be able to work as a freelancer. Well I guess the problem is the sae",0
1312,Mayola,same,0
1312,Chanelle,I'd say it's worse for freelance work.,0
1312,Mayola,haha good,0
1312,Chanelle,With permanent positions you can seek out companies that use Elm.,0
1312,Mayola,yes you're right,0
1312,Mayola,definitely right,0
1312,Chanelle,And those that do will often advertise it since it's a tech that's easy to fall in love (or at least a slight infatuation) with :wink: - so it makes them attractive workplaces.,0
1312,Mayola,ok yes,0
1312,Chanelle,Hope that's more helpfull than preachy. :sweat_smile: :slightly_smiling_face:,0
1312,Mayola,"Chanelle: , yes, sure! :wink:",0
1312,Mayola,thank you,0
1312,Shawanda,"I have an interesting bug - basically a page with a form and submit (login) that upon success redirects to another page with another form. On the new form, the first two inputs contain the values that were in the first form. Elm’s model is correct, those old form values aren’t there.. The virtual dom seems to re-use the first page’s inputs.",0
1312,Miguel,Shawanda: Try using `Html.Keyed` and see if the problem goes away.,0
1312,Shawanda,Not interesting - i guess common in virtual dom scenarios. was curious how to handle with elm,0
1312,Miguel,"Yes, the virtual dom has to guess a bit to make things faster, it doesn't always get it how we want it, so we need to give some extra information.",0
1312,Chanelle,Shawanda: how's your view code for the second page/screen look like?,0
1312,Shawanda,"Miguel: ah, using a keyed node works. thanks",0
1312,Mayola,thank you for the kind answers everyone and have a nice evening!,0
1313,Aimee,"I’m having trouble understanding “multiple types” (I’m sure that’s not the correct term). E.g. “Program Never Model Msg”, or “Cmd Msg”, or “Http.Request value”, or “Result Error value”. Could someone point me to an explanation of these “compound types”?",1
1313,Audrey,"How would I do math operations on values greater than 2,147,483,647? Is there something in the core library that can handle this?",0
1313,Katie,"Audrey: Where did you get that number, by the way?",0
1313,Katie,"Audrey: In general, any language that compiles to Javascript will have an obnoxious time dealing with large integers, since Javascript doesn't have a native integer type. (Maybe things have changed since I last looked, though, due to webasm? I'm not sure)",0
1313,Pamila,Aimee: these types are called Union Types or Algebraic Data Types,0
1313,Pamila,depending on the community you're in,0
1313,Audrey,Katie: in my elm-repl: ``` &gt; 2147483647 2147483647 : number &gt; 2147483648 -2147483648 : number ```,0
1313,Aimee,Pamila: There’s nothing that looks like that at: <https://guide.elm-lang.org/types/union_types.html>…,0
1313,Katie,"Aimee: Aimee: Pamila: I don't think those are union/algebraic types, though. At least the aspect seems to be asking about",0
1313,Katie,Those are all parametrized types,0
1313,Pamila,the parameterization in part of the algebra of algebraic data types,0
1313,Katie,"`Cmd Msg` means a command which, when it returns a response, has the ""shape"" of a `Msg`",0
1313,Aimee,"Katie: For example, where can I find the “definition” of “Program Never Model Msg”?",0
1313,Katie,"You can kind of ignore the parameters when working in your code. For instance, just think of `Cmd Msg` as just.... a command.",0
1313,Pamila,<http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/latest/Platform>,0
1313,Katie,"Aimee: <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/5.1.1/Platform#Program> &lt;-- this has the declaration. The definition is not available, though, since it is a primitive in the langauge",0
1313,Katie,"for `Program Never Model Msg`, it means you want to create a program (basically a ""main()"") which has model type `Model`, message type `Msg`, and has no flags (`Never`)",0
1313,Katie,"but again, you can safely ignore the parameters when you read it aloud to yourself and just think this is a ""Program""",0
1313,Aimee,Is there an explanation of this “concept” anywhere?,0
1313,Pamila,read further down the page on the document,0
1313,Pamila,the description is there,0
1313,Katie,"The Elm docs won't have any good explanation of the idea. It's a very basic idea from functional programming. Your best bet would probably be to google ""parametric type"" or ""parametrized type"" and look for tutorials on Haskell",0
1313,Pamila,it's in there on the union_types page,0
1313,Katie,(good explanation as in a thorough explanation. The docs will just kind of touch on the idea),0
1313,Pamila,you need to read to the bottom though,0
1313,Aimee,There’s nothing about “parameterized types” at <https://guide.elm-lang.org/types/union_types.html>,0
1313,Pamila,"it's under the heading ""Generic Data Structures""",0
1313,Katie,"Yeah. ""Generic"" type is another term (although less precise, imo). It's what Java calls the concept.",0
1313,Katie,a more basic example would like `List Int`,0
1313,Katie,"It's a list type... a list of what, though? A list of integers.",0
1313,Aimee,I understand “List Int”… a container holding ints. Some of the other ones are still baffling to me.,0
1313,Katie,"`Program Never Model Msg` is a program type.... ""a program of what, though?"" (meaning what is the associated type for its flags, model, and messages?)",0
1313,Katie,the list `[]` has type `List Int` but it doesn't contain any integers :slightly_smiling_face:,0
1313,Pamila,"if you are a C++ guy maybe you would recognize that as `Program&lt;Never,Model,Msg&gt;`",0
1313,Aimee,"Is it hierarchical or combinatorial? It sounds like it’s maybe the latter… that the order doesn’t matter? In other words, would “Program Never Model Msg” be the same as “Program Model Msg Never”?",0
1313,Katie,They are positional parameters,0
1313,Pamila,"no, the position matters",0
1313,Aimee,"I’m more of Python, C and Go guy.",0
1313,Katie,"Just like `foo(x, y)` is not the same as `foo(y, x)` in C",0
1313,Katie,(or Python),0
1313,Aimee,Hmmm… ok…,0
1313,Pamila,"hmm, one has no type, one has weak typing and one doesn't have generics",0
1313,Pamila,crap,0
1313,Katie,The first position is the flags parameter. `Never` is a special type that signals there are no flags,0
1313,Aimee,But that sounds like you’re straying into “Program -&gt; Never -&gt; etc.“.,0
1313,Katie,"The second is the model, the third is the message, ofc.",0
1313,Katie,"I would say, don't fret too much over them. You'll inevitably run into situations where you need them. And in time, it will just kind of click and make sense.",0
1313,Aimee,I’ll keep at it. It’s confusing to me…,0
1313,Katie,"the documentation is a double-edged sword, and while sometimes the types are very helpful, sometimes an example is more helpful, and it just depends on the situation.",0
1313,Aimee,I like the language a lot so far… but that one’s throwing me I have to say.,0
1313,Aimee,Thanks all.,0
1313,Pamila,make sure you read through the entire page,0
1313,Katie,"Pamila: like said, your language background carefully avoids any language that uses this notion ^^",0
1313,Katie,"But it appears in C++, Java, Haskell, and Rust, etc.",0
1313,Aimee,I should know more Haskell. No relation as far as I know.,0
1313,Pamila,Honestly elm is strictly easier than haskell. It's a gentle entry into FP but there are going to be concepts that are foreign to you.,0
1313,Katie,nod,0
1313,Aimee,"FYI, looking up “parameterized types”, found this: <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38558964/understanding-generic-union-types-in-elm>.",0
1313,Pamila,still read through the page to the bottom as it does go over it,0
1313,Aimee,Pamila: Yep. Thanks !,0
1313,Ronnie,Can anyone help me find an example of working with Task values? I'd like to use Window.width in an update calculation. The Task section of Elm guide is empty.,0
1313,Pamila,Ronnie: so `Window.width` is a task which you use `Task.perform` on to get a `Cmd msg` which you return from update and later receive the message you requested containing the width,0
1313,Pamila,you can also subscribe to `Window.resizes` and you will receive a message every time the windows width or height changes,0
1313,Pamila,Eryn: Html.keyed is the thing you want I believe,0
1313,Ronnie,"Pamila: gotcha. In this case I’m trying to do (Window.width - Mouse.Position.x). In order to get the messages at the same time, do I need to batch them?",0
1313,Pamila,You can chain with `andthen`,0
1313,Pamila,In essence you construct a task which sends you that difference.,0
1314,Wilford,"``` &gt; (12, 32) (12,32) : ( number, number1 ) ```",0
1314,Wilford,why does type annotation says `number` and `number1` ?,0
1314,Miguel,"Wilford: Because 12 could be an `Int` or a `Float`, but since you haven't used any functions on it which force it one way or the other, so it's ambiguous.",0
1314,Wilford,"Miguel: yes I know that, I'm just curious about number1",0
1314,Miguel,"32 is also a `number`, but it doesn't need to be the same as what 12 is.",0
1314,Wilford,"ah, I see",0
1314,Wilford,makes sense,0
1315,Eryn,"Pamila: Oh I see, I completely overlooked this module. I guess I should indeed have a keyed form for each of my editables. I'm not risking any performance issue with a large number of id am I?",0
1315,Eryn,"Pamila: I'm actually not sure because I want only want at a time, should I still use a Keyed container with only one `form` as it child?",0
1315,Eryn,Thanks.,0
1315,Eryn,Anyway it works with only one element even though it looks a bit overkill thanks.,0
1316,Octavio,"Does anyone know why using `Elm.Main.embed` works but `Elm.Main.fullscreen` gives me the following error, ""Oops! Something went wrong when starting your Elm program. The `Main` module does not need flags. Initialize it with no arguments and you should be all set!""",0
1316,Octavio,I'm not using program with flags,0
1316,Tabitha,"Octavio: hmm. could you show the entire line in question (from your index.js, I assume)?",0
1316,Octavio,``` var Elm = require('./Main.elm') var mount = document.getElementById('root') var app = Elm.Main.fullscreen(mount) ```,0
1316,Tabitha,"that indeed looks correct (besides the missing `;`, but that's just me, I guess). And do you have any ports that send garbage?",0
1316,Octavio,Not using ports,0
1316,Octavio,Just setting up an application,0
1316,Tabitha,"hard to remote debug. as a workaround, you could use a tool llike create-elm-app.",0
1316,Ricki,"I've been trying to work around the jumping cursor bug as it appears in my context and am having a devil of a time with it. I've posted an Ellie, <https://ellie-app.com/3yQr7JP82BPa1/7>, which isolates and illustrates the problem. I'd be most grateful if anyone could set me straight on this. *Please note* that in the Ellie, the cursor does not jump. That bad behavior of `textarea` is somehow corrected by the `style-elements` package. However, a new bug is introduced: once a textarea is edited, it can no longer be updated programmatically. In the Ellie, you see this when you try to switch documents. *Added note.* The standard way of avoiding the Jumping Cursor bug is to use `defaultValue` instead of `value`. If you do this, then you see exactly the behavior that you see in the Ellie: after editing the text field, it becomes unresponsive to changes to its value that occur programmatically.",0
1316,Ricki,"In Ellie: TextArea Bug, I am using the style-elements package",0
1316,Tabitha,"Octavio: : try `fullscreen` without anything. since its fullscreen, it doesnt need a mount node",0
1316,Tabitha,Ricki: nothing jumps for me. how to reproduce?,0
1316,Tabitha,"oh. thats not lorem impsum :slightly_smiling_face: still, no jumping.",0
1316,Ricki,"Tabitha: I did not explain very well. The `style-element` version of textarea squashes the jumping cursor bug. However, it introduces a new bug: if you edit the yellow text, then change to the other document, you will notice that the yellow text field does not update with the text of the other document. To kill the *new* bug, one is supposed to use `Html.Keyed`, as demonstrated in the `renderInput2` version. However, something is wrong there, because the textfield becomes totally unresponsive. Edit lines 95-96 to see the difference. Sorry for the confusion.",0
1316,Ricki,Please note that I corrected my explanation above,0
1316,Ricki,It should be called *TextArea Bug* as in the Ellie,0
1317,Lovie,Hi I’m having trouble with a POST request. Can somebody please have a look?,0
1317,Lovie,My code is:,0
1317,Lovie,"persistVideo: Caption -&gt; Http.Request String persistVideo caption = let url = “localhost:9024” data = encodeCaption caption |&gt; Http.jsonBody in <http://Http.post|Http.post> url data encodeCaption: Caption -&gt; Encode.Value encodeCaption caption = Encode.object [(“ident”, Encode.string caption.ident) ,(“status”, Encode.string caption.status) ,(“phrase”, Encode.string caption.phrase) ,(“video”, Encode.string caption.video) ]",0
1317,Lovie,The error message is,0
1317,Lovie,_The definition of `persistVideo` does not match its type annotation. 142| persistVideo: Caption -&gt; Http.Request String 143| persistVideo caption = 144|&gt; let 145|&gt; url = “localhost:9024” 146|&gt; data = Http.jsonBody &lt;| encodeCaption caption 147|&gt; in 148|&gt; <http://Http.post|Http.post> url data The type annotation for `persistVideo` says it always returns: Http.Request String But the returned value (shown above) is a: Decoder String -&gt; Http.Request String _,0
1317,Lovie,What’s wrong here???,0
1317,Lovie,Shouldn’t data be just the Http body?,0
1317,Miguel,`<http://Http.post|Http.post>` takes three arguments. You haven't handed it a decoder to handle the server response.,0
1317,Lovie,"Miguel: , yes I wanted to just disregard for now, but we can’t do that ??",0
1317,Miguel,"I think you could hand it a `Json.Decode.fail ""ignoring response""`, but I haven't tried it before.",0
1317,Lovie,I’ll add one,0
1317,Lovie,"Yep, that worked :slightly_smiling_face:",0
1317,Lovie,The error message threw me off there,0
1317,Lovie,Miguel: thx,0
1317,Lovie,Can I ask another more general question?,0
1317,Miguel,"No, this is no place for questions.",0
1317,Lovie,How do I do two (or more) things in 1 function?,0
1317,Lovie,even in this place of no-questions,0
1317,Lovie,;-0,0
1317,Lovie,e.g. in a funtion: fire off a ajax call AND separately update a List ?,0
1317,Lovie,it seems functions are always limited to 1 line of code,0
1317,Miguel,"A function can't produce side-effects, so it can't make server requests, get random numbers, produce the current time, etc. A function can only produce outputs based on some inputs. The only part of a function that matters is the expression at the end.",0
1317,Miguel,"If you want, you can use a `let` expression to break up making your function into multiple steps, but it doesn't really change much.",0
1317,Lovie,"hmmm i’ve seen that, yes.",0
1317,Lovie,example:,0
1317,Lovie,"addVideo: Model -&gt; Caption -&gt; (Model, Cmd Msg) addVideo model caption = let -- Ajax call to persist data persistVideo caption -- Update the entry’s video and status updateVideo entry = if entry.ident == caption.ident then { entry | video = caption.video, status = “video” } else entry in ({ model | captions = List.map updateVideo model.captions, debug = “hasRecorded” }, Cmd.none)",0
1317,Lovie,"This doesnt work, ie wont compile",0
1317,Lovie,so how do I get around this????,0
1317,Miguel,"Your `persistVideo caption` doesn't actually make the request, it produces a data structure that you can pass out to the runtime which will execute it. Presuming that `persistVideo caption` is a `Cmd Msg`, you should use its value in place of the `Cmd.none` below.",0
1317,Miguel,"Either by assigning it to a name and using it, or replacing it directly.",0
1317,Lovie,hmmmm…. persistVideo is:,0
1317,Lovie,persistVideo: Caption -&gt; Http.Request String persistVideo caption = let url = “localhost:9024” data = encodeCaption caption |&gt; Http.jsonBody in <http://Http.post|Http.post> url data persistSuccess,0
1317,Miguel,Then you need to use <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/http/1.0.0/Http#send> to turn it into a `Cmd Msg` which means you need to have a `Msg` constructor that can take a `Result Http.Error String`,0
1317,Lovie,"ahhh, Elm makes you think….",0
1317,Dortha,What are the common approaches to profiling Elm apps?,0
1317,Miguel,"Dortha: Hmmm, not sure on that. Might be a better question for <#C0CJ3SBBM|general>",0
1317,Dortha,Miguel: : Thanks!,0
1318,Marquerite,Good morning everyone! Really excited to join the chat and connect with all of you. I'm so intrigued by elm and can't wait to migrate an app I have to start using it.,0
1318,Christin,:wave:,0
1318,Marquerite,"With all that being said is anyone free to give me some advice on making the switch? I threw together a really simple prototype application for my job (not as a web developer) and it's gotten some traction and i really want to get it production ready, so my first instinct was to look towards elm to get my front end operating as smoothly as possible.",0
1318,Marquerite,"I've watched many talks and familiarized myself with the introduction to elm, but I still feel like I don't know where to start.",0
1318,Ailene,Marquerite: Hi,0
1318,Ailene,Elm is super compelling for writing front-ends,0
1318,Ailene,but you probably won't be able to salvage much from what you already have,0
1318,Ailene,so it basically have to start from the beginning,0
1318,Ailene,maybe start here,0
1318,Ailene,<http://elm-lang.org/examples/hello-html>,0
1318,Christin,"is it a prototype app, or an app you want to migrate?",0
1319,Michell,"Hi folks. Given the following data `data = [ [""Col1"", ""Col2"", ""Col3"", ""Col4""] , [""1"", ""2"", ""SC"", ""Proj1""] , [""4"", ""5"", ""RS"", ""Proj2""] , [""7"", ""8"", ""SP"", ""Proj1""] , [""10"", ""11"", ""PE"", ""Proj2""] ] ` how can I get the following: 'proj1FilteredData = [ [""Col1"", ""Col2"",] , [""1"", ""2""] , [""7"", ""8""] ] `. I'm ok doing it in JS but want to do it in Elm obviously. Any suggestion?",0
1319,Christin,What's the JS function signature?,0
1319,Christin,Are you asking about arbitrary filtering of rows and columns? Columns by name or position or both? Or something more narrow than that?,0
1319,Michell,"Christin: Sorry , got distracted with the kid. I would do this with ramdajs: `var header = head(data); var project1FilteredData = compose( map(take(2)), prepend(header), filter(arr =&gt; find(cell =&gt; cell == ""Proj1"") (arr)) )(data);`",0
1319,Christin,"Oh, ok. You can build pipelines like that, but given the data is quite untyped, you're in for dealing with a bit of `Maybe.map` and `Maybe.andThen` - ing.",0
1319,Michell,Data always come as List (List String)). That's what Google Sheets api sends back,0
1319,Michell,I think my problem is to deal with all those Maybe cases,0
1319,Christin,"Well, you can take it a step at a time. Your first `head` is going to be a Maybe. But you could start composing a function assuming you have the headers, and later wrap that in a `Maybe.map`.",0
1319,Christin,"If you do a lot of these though, you might consider parsing the data first into `List Project` or whatever your types are, then filtering/transforming without the failure cases.",0
1319,Christin,"If you are interested, I wrote a little library that lets you declaratively parse data from roughly this format into your own types.",0
1319,Michell,I'll have a go with your first suggestion,0
1319,Christin,It's sitting in a pull request here <https://github.com/periodic/elm-csv/issues/1> but I will probably spin it off into its own package,0
1319,Michell,ok.. I'll have a look at your library. Cheers,0
1320,Megan,Hey I have a real basic type question,0
1320,Megan,in the type definition `view : Model -&gt; Html Msg` in the first example at <https://github.com/evancz/elm-architecture-tutorial/blob/master/examples/01-button.elm>,0
1320,Megan,What does it mean to have two types next to each other like that,0
1320,Megan,`Html Msg` in this case,0
1320,Miguel,"Megan: Sometimes a type can have type parameters. A good example is `List`. A `List` holds values of a particular type, but it doesn't care what that type is. `List Int` means it is a list of integers. `Html Msg` refers to the types of events it can produce which call the `update` function.",0
1320,Megan,ah that makes sense,0
1320,Megan,"so, roughly, it is a generic type? Like Java's `List&lt;Integer&gt;`?",0
1320,Miguel,"That's a good place to start, although there are some differences which you shouldn't trouble yourself with.",0
1320,Megan,"yeah it's a good way for me to wrap my head around it, thanks",0
1320,Megan,"Additionally, is there a larger elm example project to look at?",0
1320,Megan,I'm curious about best practices moving beyond having a simple model / simple view example,0
1320,Miguel,<https://github.com/rtfeldman/elm-spa-example>,0
1320,Megan,Thanks I appreciate it,0
1320,Megan,plenty to look at here,0
1320,Miguel,"But just as a bit of advice, don't try to break things up too soon. Elm makes it much easier and safer to refactor later, once you know more about how your program is evolving.",0
1320,Megan,thats sounds like good advice,0
1320,Megan,Do you tend to write tests for you elm code? or do people in the community lean towards really trusting the type system?,0
1320,Miguel,It's roughly like you find anywhere. There are people who love tests and those who don't. The type system reduces the number of tests you need to write and fuzz-testing (also called 'quickcheck' or property-based testing) makes it easier to write one test which tries a good distribution of values.,0
1320,Miguel,<http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-community/elm-test/latest>,0
1321,Jonas,hi folks! it is possible to accept records from ports?,0
1321,Jonas,or I should accept raw values (via tuple for example) and construct record on Elm side?,0
1321,Jonas,"ah, just forgot about `-&gt; msg` part",0
1321,Miguel,"A fairly simple record corresponding to a JS object can be automatically decoded. If you want something more, you can also accept a `Json.Decode.Value` and then manually apply a decoder to it to make whatever you want.",0
1321,Miguel,The latter also has the benefit of not crashing if you pass something which doesn't decode properly.,0
1321,Jonas,"yeah, I think this record is pretty simple for decoding (geojson ""Feature"").",0
1321,Jonas,btw should I manually handle `type` keys when iterop? it's a `type_` in Elm side and now I am map list of objects at js side to rename this key (to `type` as it should be),0
1321,Jonas,so it looks like this now: API using `type` key -&gt; mapping it to `type_` in elm side -&gt; passing to ports -&gt; JS mapping list to `type` key again :smile:,0
1321,Jonas,"not a problem at all, just curious",0
1321,Miguel,"Yeah, I don't know how the automatic decoder handles `type`. I wouldn't be surprised either way, but would have to see it to find out. Honestly, I prefer manual decoding/encoding so I would probably just make decoders and encoders on the Elm side and use `Json.Decode.Value`s.",0
1322,Ethelene,"Hi, anybody can help me with this.... what's wrong here? Compiler complains with -- NAMING ERROR -------Main.elm Cannot find variable `Username` 221| User (Username user) """" == In my Data/User.elm == type alias User = { username : Username , email : String } type Username = Username String == In Main.elm == import Data.User exposing (User, Username) (inside a ""let .... in ...""

1322,Christin,"Ethelene: your `type Username = Username String` is an opaque type. This means that you can import the type (in Main for instance), but not the constructor (the `Username` on the ""right side"" of your definition). It's private to the `Data.User` module.",0

1324,Chiquita,hey o/ `renderPart : (Int -&gt; Bool -&gt; NumberDisplay -&gt; String) -&gt; Int -&gt; Int -&gt; List Int -&gt; Html Msg`,0
1324,Chiquita,I'd like to know if I can define somehow a type for my first function argument type (which is obviously a function),0
1324,Chiquita,"a sort of a function signature shortcut, which would allow me to write `renderPart : Renderer -&gt; Int -&gt; Int -&gt; List Int -&gt; Html Msg`",0

1324,Chiquita,hmm I find no doc about functions annotation alias types,0
1325,Fanny,hello all... is it fair to assume this is a 'there are no stupid questions' type of room? i have a very very nooby question (but i couldnt find the answer in the FAQ),0
1325,Chiquita,"totally fair, don't be shy :smiley:",0
1325,Fanny,thanks. :slightly_smiling_face: i'm finally diving deep into elm (i come from a python background with a little C++). I love it... functional programming has that feels rightness about it.,0
1325,Katie,"That's not technically a question, but the answer is yes :stuck_out_tongue:",0

1325,Fanny,"i'm making a personal website, and using elm-mdl... but i'm new to serious web dev. i notice that the mdl visuals dont render when i'm working offline. i'm assuming that the library is grabbing the fancy stuff from somewhere, but is there any way i can keep whatever it's trying to access locally?",0
1325,Chiquita,"ouch, that doesn't sound so newbish to me :smiley:",0
1325,Fanny,"everything compiles, and my static html objects will display (text and such), but the actual styles are ignored unless i have an active internet connection. so elm-mdl doesnt keep those on hand. but how would i get it?",0
1325,Chiquita,I don't know the answer but maybe you can give a try on <#C12KMAYJX|elm-mdl>,0
1325,Fanny,perhaps it isn't... but i was advised to avoid writing my own css if i'm new to front end development.,0
1325,Chiquita,that's maybe du to an external reference of a .css file in your `index.html` file?,0
1325,Katie,"That's an odd piece of advise. I would say you want to know how the CSS works if you're new. Although maybe if you're working on an existing project, they'd rather have you use a higher level tool, since raw CSS gets to be kind of a mess",0
1325,Fanny,"yeah... i've done some very basic css work. i know all the keywords and I can read a html/css file and understand whats happening... but constructive all the relevant css for a site is still daunting. i've used bootstrap with python projects, but mdl seemed the most robust thing out there for elm with great documentation, and i liked the aesthetic.",0
1325,Fanny,Chiquita: thanks. i'll ask in the mdl channel and check out what's going on in my index file.,0
1325,Fanny,i've pretty much drank the elm koolaid at this point... i tried getting into javascript but the language feels... messy. i also toyed with haskell for a bit but never got to the point of being useful. elm possess that mixture of practicality and correctness. and a magical compiler.,0

1326,Ok,"i'm thinking how do we handle a textbox that holds a field of type float. Whenever a user inputs a dot, it doesn't pass as a valid float (in the update) and then the re-render causes the textbox to remove the dot. Same goes for clearing/emptying out such a field .",0
1326,Ricki,Are you setting `value` ?,0
1326,Ok,Ricki: yes,0
1326,Luci,Ok: Maybe you should have two different checks for whether the input is valid. One for when the user is still typing and another for when they attempt to submit the value.,0
1326,Ok,yeah! i was thinking of that as well. Earlier method seemed like the easy way out :smile:,0
1326,Ok,Another thought was to do the check onBlur but unfortunately we don't have the value on blur. Maybe i'll try to write a custom onBlur event handler,0

1327,Kiana,is there a syntax for combining exposing all `module My.Module exposing (..)` with exposing union types `module My.Module exposing (MyType(..))`?,0
1327,Jewel,Kiana: combining how?,0
1327,Kiana,"just wanted to expose everything in my module, but it seems to be having trouble with me union types when i try to access them in other files",0
1327,Kiana,woops i figured it out.. my mistake. thanks for the quick feedback though!,0
1327,Octavio,How do I create commands? I'm not finding any docs about it,0
1327,Octavio,And how do I use `if else` with Maybes?,0
1327,Kiana,<https://www.elm-tutorial.org/en/03-subs-cmds/02-commands.html>,0
1327,Octavio,"Yes but it's not really helpful, because it only shows how Random gives you a command, not how to issue one of your own",0
1327,Kiana,from my understanding commands can only be called in the update,0
1327,Octavio,Yup,0
1327,Steffanie,"Octavio: a Cmd is a structure that the runtime can interpret and allows the runtime to execute something, after which it would call your update with the resulting msg. What is your use-case for creating commands?",0
1327,Steffanie,as for `if..else` with `Maybe`; could you explain what you're trying to achieve? I'm sure we can help you figure out how to best handle it :slightly_smiling_face:,0
1327,Octavio,"Basically, in pseudo-elm code",0
1327,Octavio,"`cmd = if model.user then Cmd.none else ChangeLocation ""sign-in""`",0
1327,Octavio,model.user is a `Maybe User`,0
1327,Steffanie,"Right, so, `ChangeLocation ""foo""` is a branch of your `update`, right?",0
1327,Octavio,Yup,0
1327,Steffanie,"Does it change anything in your model, or does it just return your model and adds a cmd to actually go to a different page?",0
1327,Octavio,"If the command is ChangeLocation, then model.route would also need to be updated",0
1327,Octavio,So the url and route match,0
1327,Steffanie,"Right. So what you'd basically do is take the content of that branch of your update, turn it into a function, and call that",0
1327,Steffanie,"I mean, you already _have_ the code you want to execute, now you just need to call it. But rather than you telling the runtime to execute your `update` with a certain message, you can just call it directly",0
1327,Octavio,"Sure. But then this branch of `update` would just return `(model, Cmd.none)` if that's the case?",0
1327,Octavio,If I call `update` with another message directly?,0
1327,Steffanie,"I wouldn't call `update` directly, making `update` a recursive function can get confusing while there's no real need for that. Taking the code you actually need (the content of tht branch) and putting it into a function, then calling that function from both places is going to be much easier",0
1327,Octavio,Then you lost me. :slightly_smiling_face: Cause I thought we were talking about recursive update calls,0
1327,Steffanie,"I see how I could've given you that idea, but I was rather talking about calling the common code directly, rather than update itself. Could you perhaps post your update somewhere? I could give you some pointers :slightly_smiling_face:",0
1327,Octavio,"``` update : Msg -&gt; Model -&gt; ( Model, Cmd a ) update msg model = case msg of ChangeLocation path -&gt; ( model, Navigation.newUrl path ) OnLocationChange location -&gt; let newRoute = location |&gt; parseLocation cmd = if model.user then Cmd.none else ChangeLocation ""sign-in"" in ( { model | route = newRoute }, cmd ) ```",0
1327,Steffanie,"Right, so, the simplest thing to do here would be `cmd = if model.user == Nothing then Navigation.newUrl ""sign-in"" else Cmd.none`",0
1327,Octavio,Hmm true true,0
1327,Steffanie,"(you'll need `(Model, Cmd Msg)` in your type annotation, tho)",0
1327,Octavio,Thanks for the guidance!,0
1328,Octavio,Does Elm use `and` or `&amp;&amp;`?,0
1328,Octavio,Feels like it _should_ be `and` but the compiler doesn't recognize it,0
1328,Octavio,Perhaps I'm missing some parentheses,0
1328,Steffanie,"Octavio: it's `&amp;&amp;`, <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/5.1.1/Basics#&amp;&amp;>",0

1328,Steffanie,`/=` in elm,0
1328,Steffanie,"though if you're still dealing with `Maybe`, it's often more readable to use `Maybe.map` and - possibly - `Maybe.withDefault` to fallback to a default value.",0
1328,Octavio,"If I have these types, ``` type PrivateRoute = HomeRoute type PublicRoute = AboutRoute | NotFoundRoute | SignInRoute type Route = PrivateRoute | PublicRoute ``` can't `PrivateRoute` and `PublicRoute` be matched as `Route`? :confused: Trying to put together something that allows me to use a single `case route of` to work with private or public routes",0
1328,Octavio,"In case of a private route, I need to do something. In case of public route, I need to do something else",0
1328,Steffanie,"You can't ""sum"" types like that, but you can tag them - `type Route = Private PrivateRoute | Public PublicRoute`",0
1328,Steffanie,"you can use these in a single case, btw: ``` case route of Private HomeRoute -&gt; ... Public AboutRoute -&gt; ... Public NotFoundRoute -&gt; ... Public _ -&gt; ... ```",0
1328,Octavio,Thanks again,0
1328,Octavio,"If `Models` has this type, ``` type Route = RouteName PrivateRoute ``` Why does an import of `Models` and the use of `Models.Route` somewhere yield a ""Models does not expose Route"" error?",0
1328,Chiquita,"You can expose an union type outside of your module but by default, it does not expose its constructors",0
1328,Chiquita,you have to make something like `export (Route(..))`,0

1329,Raguel,"Hey, I have a question: I need to display a svg generated by a .js file, I guess I should use ports but I couldn’t actually think how to use ports with that? Thanks for the help in advance!",0
1329,Hilaria,Raguel: I can think of two solutions,0
1329,Hilaria,One would be the manually append it to an html element generated in Elm.,0
1329,Hilaria,"So in elm make `div [ id ""svg-container"" ] [] ` and in in JS write `var svgContainer = document.getElementById(""svg-container"")` and append your svg to `svgContainer`",0
1329,Hilaria,"The other would be to convert the svg to json, and then pass it through the port, and the decode it in Elm",0
1329,Hilaria,"`&lt;svg&gt;&lt;circle fill=""blue""&gt;&lt;/circle&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;` -&gt; `{tag:""svg"", children: [ {tag:""circle"", fill:""blue"", children: [] } ] }`",0
1329,Hilaria,"The first would be far easier, but it might be unstable, and kind of hacky. Because the Elm virtual dom might whip it away if it has reason to update the svg’s parent element.",0
1329,Luci,Raguel: Could you generate the SVG in Elm instead using [elm-lang/svg](<http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/svg/latest>)?,0
1329,Christin,I take it the svg is dynamically generated? Otherwise you could save it to a file and `use xlink:href=...`,0
1329,Elissa,You can also use this script to convert it to elm-svg if it’s a statically generated SVG file: <https://gist.github.com/eeue56/d0ab060828bf3b64922ac9172ee430c3>,0

1330,Agustin,hello all,0
1330,Agustin,"```module `Html.Attributes` does not expose `Attribute` import Html.Attributes exposing (style, Attribute)```",0
1330,Agustin,how does the `Attributes` library not expose `Attribute`,0
1330,Chiquita,"Agustin: because `Attribute` is what we call an ""opaque"" type",0
1330,Chiquita,<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40794368/what-is-an-opaque-type-in-elm-and-why-is-it-valuable>,0
1330,Chiquita,It means you shouldn't manipulate an `Attribute` _directly_ but through some exposed functions,0
1330,Katie,Opaque types are essentially what C++ and Java would call abstract types,0
1330,Katie,You never call constructors for them directly and you never pattern-match on them with `case` directly. You have to go through the public API to work with them.,0
1330,Katie,"It's like ""all rights reserved"" for the implementation, since the library owner can make changes without fear of breaking any existing code",0
1330,Agustin,OK. `Svg` exposes itself. so does `Html` but `Attributes` doesn't not. Fine,0
1330,Katie,"I can't vouch for the design choice on `Html`, but it's a bit odd to see that it does.",0

1330,Katie,"sadly, I haven't worked through the JSON tutorial yet, or I could probably help &gt;_&gt;",0
1330,Katie,How is the `Array` type implemented?,0
1330,Luci,Agustin: You just got the import slightly wrong. It should be `import Html exposing (Attribute)`,0
1330,Luci,Attribute being an opaque type is somewhat peripheral to the matter,0
1330,Luci,Agustin: You need to create a decoder. <http://json2elm.com> might be helpful.,0
1330,Luci,I’m not sure what you mean by “knowing the structure all at once.” Don’t you need to know that anyway in order to extract the parts of the data that you care about in JS.,0
1331,Elissa,"Folks, explaining what an opaque type in this context was not the right path to go down, and can lead to more confusion than aid. It’s best to identify what the questioner is actually stuck on before answering in such situations",0

The project includes a scientific calculation (will be done on the server), but for that the user will have to enter around 30 different input values (it's a tool from and for scientists basically). The field types are a mixture of text, numbers and selects where different select options result in different inputs showing and not showing. After reading the guide for elm on the official page I'm concerned having 30+ input fields will result in a lot of Message Types and a quite unwieldy update function etc?",0

1339,Steffanie,"Suzie: a single value, but you can use a tuple, record or list to get multiple things in a single value. `port fooBar : (String, String) -&gt; Cmd msg` for example, which will translate to an array of 2 strings in JS",0
1339,Steffanie,"or `port fooBar : { foo : String, bar : String } -&gt; Cmd msg` which will be an object with 2 keys, foo and bar, in JS",0
1339,Steffanie,"<https://guide.elm-lang.org/interop/javascript.html#customs-and-border-protection> for the complete list of ""autoconverted"" values",0
1339,Suzie,"brilliant, thanks",0
1339,Suzie,that example is just what I was after,0
1340,Elissa,You can also use a decoder and encoder to send more complicated objects in and out of Elm,0
1340,Elissa,"Requires a bit more legwork, but it is a good option to turn to if you already have them :slightly_smiling_face:",0
1340,Brittaney,"I have : ```data=[[163229,""Mon"",""a""],[248083,""Wed"",""b""]] dims=[""dim1"", ""dim2"", ""dim3""]``` I want to make array of records: ```[{""dim1"":163229,""dim2"":""Mon"",""dim3"":""a""}, {""dim1"":248083,""dim2"":""Wed"",""dim3"":""b""}]``` I bet I have to do something like below (with fix): ```List.map (\el -&gt; List.map2 (\val dim -&gt; dim=val) el dims ) data``` How to enforce in outer lambda to instantiate record?",0
1340,Elissa,"In Elm, we don’t really have instances of records.",0
1340,Elissa,"This is how you create a record: ``` makeDimRecord dim1 dim2 dim3 = { dim1 = dim1 , dim2 = dim2 , dim3 = dim3 } ```",0
1340,Elissa,Elm will automatically make this function for you when you make a type alias,0
1340,Elissa,"``` type alias Dims = { dim1 : Int , dim2 : String , dim3 : String } -- Dims is the same as the makeDimRecord shown above ```",0
1340,Elissa,"Next, you probably don’t want lists. You probably want a list of tuples.",0
1340,Elissa,"`data= [(163229,""Mon"",""a""),(248083,""Wed"",""b"")]`",0
1340,Elissa,"If you don’t know the name or the number of fields you’ll have at compile time, you are better off using a `Dict`, which is otherwise known as a hash, a table, or a map",0
1340,Elissa,"``` Dict.fromList [ (""dim1"", dim1), (""dim2"", dim2), (""dim3"", dim3) ] ```",0
1340,Elissa,"You can’t have a record with a changing number of fields. You must know all the fields at compile time. With a dict, you can plop whatever you want in there.",0
1340,Brittaney,"ok, thank you. how to go from [Dict.fromList[], ..., Dict.fromList[]] to [record, ..., record]",0
1340,Elissa,Do you know all the fields at compile time?,0
1340,Elissa,"If you don’t, then you can’t.",0
1340,Miguel,We might want to explore why you have a `Dict` to begin with.,0
1340,Brittaney,I do not know data and dims at compile time,0
1340,Elissa,Where is this data coming from?,0
1340,Brittaney,From server,0
1340,Elissa,Who’s server?,0
1340,Brittaney,third party server,0
1340,Elissa,Do they have an API or spec?,0
1340,Elissa,"If you are getting data from there, then they probably have some consistent data structure that they are sending you back.",0
1340,Elissa,"If not, then you have to use a Dict",0
1340,Brittaney,"ok, I got it that Dict is more suitable. But how to get from ```[[Dict.fromList [(""count"",""163229"")],Dict.fromList [(""bestDay"",""Mon"")],Dict.fromList [(""data.markets.instrument"",""deposit"")]],[Dict.fromList [(""count"",""248083"")],Dict.fromList [(""bestDay"",""Wed"")],Dict.fromList [(""data.markets.instrument"",""spot"")]],[Dict.fromList [(""count"",""105479"")],Dict.fromList [(""bestDay"",""Fri"")],Dict.fromList [(""data.markets.instrument"",""swap"")]]]``` to array of three records - I do not know names, number of objects at compile time?",0
1340,Elissa,"Like I said, you _can’t_",0
1340,Elissa,That’s not how records work. The fields are fixed at compile time.,0
1340,Elissa,"Otherwise, you can’t provide any kind of type safety, because any dynamically added field to an object changes the type of that object.",0
1340,Elissa,"Hence why `Dict` is what you have to use - a Dict can store keys and values, without needing to care about the fields other than the key must be a certain type, and the value for each key must be a certain type",0

1664,Renee,I'd be interested in comments on this somewhat old article: <http://reasonablypolymorphic.com/blog/elm-is-wrong>,0
1664,Liberty,"if you think elm should be ""haskell in the browser"", those are totally valid points. if you think it should be the ""the best experience for building interactive webapps"", then maybe those features aren't as necessary as you think.",0
1664,Renee,Liberty: Sounds reasonable to me. Is performance also an issue?,0
1664,Liberty,the frontend comes with some interesting performance characteristics: DOM manipulation is almost always the bottleneck.,0
1664,Renee,I should say that my own experience with Elm (about 2 months in) is: it is fantastic.,0
1664,Liberty,it's great for the problem that it tries to solve.,0
1664,Joni,"Renee: that post has been discussed a lot. It sparked a rather large discussion on reddit ( <https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/5bsanc/elm_is_wrong_reasonably_polymorphic/> ), got blogged about ( <https://www.gizra.com/content/elm-business-perspective/> ), was mentioned and discussed in podcasts (<https://www.magicreadalong.com/episode/41> and <https://www.magicreadalong.com/episode/43>) and so on and so forth. Basically, it's what folkert says - from the perspective of ""Elm should be haskell"" it's valid criticism. From the perspective of ""Elm isn't viable without the features I wish it had"", it's not nearly nuanced enough, at best.",0
1664,Renee,"Joni: , Thanks! I'm interested in hearing all sides, even though I am pretty much convinced, have had an excellent experience so far ... and have committed the future of my current app to it :grinning:",0

1666,Lanita,"Hi, I'd like to discuss about `Html.Events.on` behavior when decoder fails, and perhaps adding some explanation to the docs. Should I go to <#C0Y4Z2G4F|core> or another channel?",0
1666,Margit,here is fine,0
1666,Margit,"Lanita: when the decoder fails, nothing is triggered.",0
1666,Margit,<https://github.com/elm-lang/virtual-dom/blob/master/src/Native/VirtualDom.js#L444>,0

1666,Joni,"Which means, somewhat ""awkwardly"", you need a `NoOp` to `preventDefault` _and_ do nothing. Doesn't come up too often, tho..",0
1666,Mika,this is also a feature though as it creates the possibility of conditional eventhandlers,0
1666,Lanita,"eeue56: Yes, I spotted the `VirtualDom.js` file, also an [elm-discuss topic](<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/elm-discuss/YROzE689bIo>) about it",0
1666,Lanita,"I wondered if it should be a good idea to explicit that in the [doc of Html.Events.on](<http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/html/2.0.0/Html-Events#on>) Something like ""If successful, the value is routed to your update function. In case of failure, the update function won't be triggered and nothing will be logged to the console.""",0

1667,Florence,is there a currently most popular thing or stack of things for making talking to json apis and encoding/decoding slightly more convenient?,1

1667,Florence,"Well, it's been a while, but for example, when I'm first writing decoders and doing a bad job, something goes wrong, and there's no way to tell what it was. Maybe I just want to look at an example app with more going on than the <http://elm-lang.org|elm-lang.org> examples",0
1667,Liberty,for the boring stuff there is <http://eeue56.github.io/json-to-elm/> - it automatically generates decoders as well as it can,0
1667,Liberty,"if you have tricky json/specific problems, just ask here",0
1667,Florence,oh nice,0
1667,Liberty,I can also recommend to use the pipeline package/option <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/NoRedInk/elm-decode-pipeline/latest>,0

1667,Florence,oh nice. that'll get me going.,0
1668,Eunice,Is it possible to embed an Elm app _inside_ a react app?,0
1668,Eunice,I found this (<https://stackoverflow.com/a/41369057>) but apparently that doesn’t work according to the comment. I’m also wondering if there’s a cleaner way via web components? “Don’t do that” is not an answer to this question :slightly_smiling_face:. We have our reasons.,0
1668,Eunice,I get that in general it’s a bad idea.,0
1668,Karan,Eunice: you want <https://github.com/evancz/react-elm-components>,0
1668,Eunice,:thumbsup:,0
1668,Eunice,I got mixed up - it’s the other way around that’s problematic.,0
1668,Eunice,The link I put in is for the reverse - just ignore that everyone.,0
1668,Eunice,If you want to use a React component inside an Elm app.,0
1668,Karan,"yeah, if you’re ever doing that, web components are definitely the easiest way to put React apps inside Elm apps.",0
1668,Eunice,"Have you tried.. is it easy? Any caveats? We’re also interested in that, but no immediate requirement for it (we have React teams and an Elm team)",0
1668,Karan,have you seen <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ar3TakwE8o0> ?,0
1668,Eunice,Cool. I'll check it out. Thanks.,0
1668,Genaro,Eunice: btw thanks for <https://mbylstra.github.io/html-to-elm/> - it really helped me get <https://github.com/rtfeldman/elm-spa-example> off the ground!,0
1668,Eunice,"Ah no problem! When I started with Elm I found that the html syntax was one of the most challenging things for me (coming from React JSX and 15+ years of HTML), so that’s why I wrote it.",0
1668,Eunice,Genaro: I just had a quick scan of the “Elm and Web Components” video. Cool stuff. : I’m curious if you’ve used that in production? Have you heard of anyone using it in prod? We might have to seriously consider it at some point.,0
1668,Eunice,Do you think there would be any additional problems with embedding a React component inside a web component inside an Elm app?,0
1668,Genaro,"I have not used it in prod, but I've heard of people doing it",0
1668,Genaro,there's a <#C13J25YQK|webcomponents> channel,0
1668,Genaro,the polyfills for older browsers are pretty rough,0
1668,Eunice,"After having a quick look at our React components to see how viable this might be, the thing that jumped out at me was that any React component that does anything with `props.children` or took a dom element as a prop could be a problem. Lets say you had a Google-Maps-like React component that took a custom pin/marker as a prop - I don’t think you’d be able to pass in an Elm Html msg as a prop (or at least you’d have to do some serious voodoo to get that to work).",0
1668,Eunice,I still think it’s a viable idea - I’m just wondering what’s possible or not.,0
1668,Elisabeth,Eunice: for raw HTML you could write a tiny native module that implements a custom node (I've also seen people suggesting to use a Markdown library to abuse the native extension there),0
1668,Elisabeth,But that's two layers of unsupported: Native + custom nodes ;-),0
1669,Graham,So I wrote up some questions around ownership of data in a blog post here <https://medium.com/@julianjelfs_61852/the-importance-of-state-ownership-in-elm-72f711ceb244> But really it's a cry for help! Don't feel like I have a satisfactory answer yet - If anyone has any thoughts I'd love to hear them...,0
1669,Eunice,"Did you look at elm-taco? It is somewhat of a solution to the compromise of ""having to pass the data all the way down"". It's kind of a convention for doing that.",0
1669,Jeanett,"it really is just ""creating a big common/shared state alongside each other piece of state""",0
1669,Jeanett,which I find to be both great and unsatisfactory :smiley:,0
1669,Teresa,why is it unsatisfactory?,0
1669,Teresa,"because it's a ""boring"" solution? :slightly_smiling_face:",0
1669,Eunice,I find it totally satisfactory.,0
1669,Jeanett,"because why not put everything in there, then?",0
1669,Jeanett,"I don't mind boring, at all",0
1669,Eunice,Good question really - why _not_ put everything there?,0
1669,Graham,I think the answer would be that you throw away encapsulation which I think is a valuable thing.,0
1669,Teresa,A practical example: our application had more than ten forms. Having the state of all of those fields in the one non-nested record would have been rather... interesting.,0
1669,Graham,So are we suggesting that all update and view signatures replace `Model -&gt;` with `CommonStuff -&gt; Model -&gt;`,0
1669,Teresa,You probably don't need it for updates.,0
1669,Vivian,rtfeldman: mbylstra's project is awesome but why not use the `Html to Elm` pluggins for the editors. The SublimeText one is amazingly useful.,0
1669,Teresa,Only for views,0
1669,Graham,I have found that sometimes I _do_ need it for updates (though less often),0
1669,Liberty,updates can need extra config too. Passing it explicitly is the only way to maintain one source of truth,0
1669,Teresa,"Put the necessary part of the common stuff in the `Msg`, and you don't.",0
1669,Jeanett,"ohanhi: but then, you have out-of-sync issues",0
1669,Teresa,E.g. `onSubmit (UpdateUser taco.userId)`,0
1669,Graham,"If you are using a component, you don't always have that much control over the Msg",0
1669,Graham,that's the one problem scenario where I needed this stuff in the update as well,0
1669,Teresa,fair enough,0
1669,Jeanett,"often, the solution I've seen to this is that, instead of using the same kind of escape hatch that Redux allows with `connect`, people use the `URL bar` escape hatch :smiley:",0
1669,Graham,"Generally I just wanted to call this out, because it is very tempting and very easy to end up in the two sources of truth trap and then weirdness ensues.",0
1669,Graham,Seems it just has to be that way and I still find it vaguely unsatisfactory but I don't quite know why.,0
1669,Teresa,"In fact, we started with a ""Context"" that was passed to pages on `init`, and usually saved in the page `Model`. That became a huge mess, hence elm-taco.",0
1669,Jeanett,"that's what I meant earlier: it's a great formalism, that's really helpful, but I still feel there has to be a better way to handle interdependency and such",0
1669,Graham,OK sounds like I should check out elm-taco - thanks,0
1669,Eunice,I agree this is better handled in an editor plugin. I think an online version is handy for beginners (who havent got to the point of setting up editor plugins). The html parser and elm formatter that i wrote may or may not be better than the atom or sublime ones - i havent compared. It'd be good if they all used the same parser. Mine is a bit of a hack - my first ever elm project. I wrote a parser combinator completely from scratch in order to learn Elm. I think it's pretty solid though because Elm.,0
1669,Eunice,"I didnt even know that i was writing a ""parser combinator"" but it turns out i did. It's just the most natural way you'd write a parser in a language like elm.",0
1669,Vivian,Graham: have you see `elm-spa-example`?,0
1669,Vivian,it is another way to solve the issue you mention.,0
1669,Vivian,the basic pattern is to have a context (`session`) that is sent to all child updates and views.,0
1669,Teresa,It really is the same as taco,0
1669,Graham,"yep, just seems to boil down to passing around an extra thing.",0
1669,Margit,"Eh, that’s becuase `alt` is not for mouseover",0
1669,Margit,"`alt` is for when `src` fails to load, or the user is using a screen-reader.",0
1669,Margit,Use `title` for tooltips.,0
1669,Janel,Roger that :slightly_smiling_face:,0
1669,Janel,"Hmmm, spooky, doesn't work either (and ALT shows up on HTML) ... I'm using :firefox: ...",0
1669,Jeanett,what doesn't?,0
1669,Janel,"Margit: tooltips on images as described ... I mean normally if I want text on mouse over, I would with HTML just add the `alt` tag with a text.",0
1669,Janel,My problem is that the `alt` tag appears on the underlaying HTML but it doesn't work :neutral_face:,0
1669,Janel,:chrome: has the same problem ...,0
1669,Jeanett,"well, he just told you that you're thinking of the `title` attribute",0
1669,Jeanett,"`alt` is an attribute for `img` that is used to display text, instead of a ""broken image"" icon, when the browser fails to load the image",0
1669,Jeanett,it is also used to describe the image when using a screen reader,0
1669,Jeanett,unless I've misunderstood your problem?,0
1669,Janel,I used `title` and that doesn't work either :disappointed:,0
1669,Jeanett,<https://ellie-app.com/3wBNz5ghtWNa1/0>,0
1669,Jeanett,this minimal example seems to behave correctly,0
1669,Jeanett,how does it work in your browsers?,0
1669,Marget,Working fine on my FF,0
1669,Jeanett,Janel: Marget: thanks :smiley: what about yours?,0
1669,Janel,Something strange is going on with my :firefox: I think. I will be back once I restart it (to many open tabs in Private Mode) :smile:,0
1669,Jeanett,so does that mean that the Ellie doesn't work?,0
1669,Janel,Ellie works,0
1669,Janel,Mine doesn't :neutral_face:,0
1669,Teresa,Janel: Are you 100% sure you have the `title` attribute present?,0
1669,Janel,and now it does. WTF !!!,0
1669,Janel,I mean ... :neutral_face:,0
1669,Janel,"Non-deterministic, that's the main reason we use :elm: :smile:",0
1669,Margit,Pretty sure it’s most likely that your browser was caching the page,0
1669,Janel,But I had the text already on. Deleted `elm-stuff` and built from sracth though,0
1669,Jeanett,"yeah, HTML/title/alt is pretty reliable ^^",0
1669,Janel,"Oh, yeah, I had `alt` on and not `title`. So yeah `cache` it is :wink:",0
1669,Laraine,i want to know - it is possible to have data scructure like a `Dict` - that can hold items of different types - i'm not referring to the key - i'm referring to the value inside - this value to be of different types - i'm asking if this is not possible because of math - how category theory works (don't know much about that) -&gt; or is not implemented like this for other reasons - ease of reasoning maybe - or is a good constraint to have when designing the data structure or something of this nature... Does `haskell` or more powerful functional languages provide this functionality? - or is actually not possible to have because of the math behind?,0
1669,Margit,Typeclasses.,0
1669,Margit,"In Elm, use this: `type MyThing = AnInt Int | AString String`",0
1669,Margit,Which lets you make `Dict comparable MyThing`,0
1669,Laraine,hmm yeah that's one way to do it. Ok now i know where typeclases can be useful :smile: thanks,0
1669,Joni,"Laraine: regardless of typeclasses, what would the type signature for `Dict.get` look like - keeping in mind that type-information isn't available at runtime..? :slightly_smiling_face:",0
1669,Laraine,yes i don't see how it will be possible to enforce `case ..of` statements if not knowing the type. You will end up not handling stuff -so there will be run-time exceptions. Hmm forget about it - im not experienced enough to understand the implications here . Just being curious :smile:,0
1669,Teresa,"In Haskell, you can choose to not be exhaustive in `case-of`s, and that will lead to runtime errors if those missing cases happen.",0
1669,Rufina,"Haskell has a type called Dynamic, which carries a runtime type annotation with it which can be used to cast the value: <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.9.1.0/docs/Data-Dynamic.html>",0
1669,Rufina,but it's very rarely used,0
1669,Margit,Look at this in F#: <https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/discriminated-unions/>,0
1669,Polly,Laraine: what your asking for is perfectly possible with a stronger type system: <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/dependent-map>,0
1669,Polly,and you don't have to give up exhaustivity at all,0
1669,Margit,"Eh, you don’t need a stronger type system - see how F# does it, and that is not more abstract than Elm. :slightly_smiling_face:",0
1669,Polly,They do different,0
1669,Polly,things*,0
1669,Margit,It achieves the same goal.,0
1669,Polly,Ish,0
1669,Laraine,Rufina: Joni: Margit: Polly: thanks all for explaining - pff this stuff pretty mind bending :smile:,0
1669,Polly,"The Haskell solution witnesses a specific type at particular indices. F# cannot guarantee that, so you still have to match more cases than you would like to model.",0
1669,Polly,`Dict.get 5 (Dict.insert 5 (ABoolean True))` cannot _guarantee_ that `ABoolean` comes back.,0
1669,Polly,It says that you might get `AnInt` or `AFooble`,0
1669,Margit,"It achieves the same goal, which is to have mixed types in a collection.",0
1669,Polly,"Maybe you're ok with that, I'm just saying - the more power you give to your types, the more you can model",0
1669,Polly,"Of course, but one leads me to a situation where I might get ""stuck"". In the above example, I _have_ to match an `AnInt`, even though that might be impossible. So what do I do? Writing `crash ""impossible""` isn't particularly elegant, but often the best you can do",0
1669,Polly,"Laraine: Not arguing for this, just showing that type systems have various levels of expressivity",0
1669,Hertha,There are definitely stronger type systems. Then you’d have to grok things like this :slightly_smiling_face: ``` data DSum k tag f :: forall k. (k -&gt; *) -&gt; (k -&gt; *) -&gt; * where ```,0
1669,Polly,"<https://www.reddit.com/r/elm/comments/3hhlsp/htmllazy_for_any_number_of_arguments/cu7fn9d/> is this really true? The comment says how to write `lazy4` by using tuples, but lazy is defined using pointer equality on the argument, and surely every time the model changes you'll get a different tuple pointer, so the whole thing breaks?",0
1669,Margit,Old lazy is different from new lazy,0
1669,Polly,Ah,0
1669,Hertha,"I’ve noticed this too, with lazy. It’s not obvious, and it sort of goes against the notion to make your function types less general, for instance if you have a view function that only uses part of the model, you’d like to call it with just that part, but then you can’t use lazy",0
1669,Polly,"Sure you can, `lazy f foo.bar` is fine",0
1669,Polly,"Or did you mean `lazy (\{bar} -&gt; f bar) foo`, and have that be actually lazy on `foo.bar`?",0
1669,Hertha,"it is, but `lazy f (foo.bar, foo.baz, foo.qux, foo.quux)` isn’t and `lazy4` is not defined",0
1669,Hertha,"So, let’s say I have a model that updates frequently (some animation or whatnot) and then I have another part of the view that uses four fields from the model. Agreed, it’s not a very common case, but still",0
1669,Polly,right,0
1669,Hertha,"but in the process of making your function type more specific this will probably happen more often, since you replace `model` by specifc fields in the `model`",0
1669,Hertha,"So, having `lazy` work with a tuple or record by checking the fields is something to consider. Or adding a version of `lazy` that does",0
1669,Hertha,"I’ve started to make functions like this, which is pretty nice, as you can pass the `model` but it’s still specific. ``` viewX : { m | foo : Foo, bar : Bar } -&gt; Html msg ``` and so, to make it `lazy` you’d then just do `lazyThatWorksOnRecord viewX { foo: model.foo, bar: model.bar }` and not have to change the function style",0
1670,Jeanett,"I've got a UI question: I'm using RemoteData/WebData, so when my users submit something, I switch a value to`Loading` before the value is turned into a `Failure`/`Success`. Initially, I wanted to show a ""Loading"" message while the value was `Loading`; however, most of the time, it only stays `Loading` for a very brief time, which leads to the UI flashing and the ""Loading"" content not being readable",0
1670,Jeanett,"in my Redux days, I used to delay updating the model for about 0.4 or 0.5s so that users could see what the flash was about",0
1670,Jeanett,how would you deal with that in Elm?,0
1670,Ima,I think you can try adding an animation delay - see here for more info: <https://dev.to/rtfeldman/tour-of-an-open-source-elm-spa>,0
1670,Jeanett,"ah yeah, thanks; I'll look into it but I'd like a no-CSS solution if possible",0
1670,Janine,Jeanett: You can return a `Cmd` from your update that triggers in .5s.,0
1670,Janine,That’s what we do with our flash messages.,0
1670,Jeanett,"ideally, I'd like the ""entire process"" to take ""at least 0.5s"" but no longer that strictly useful",0
1670,Jeanett,"ie, if it takes less than 0.5, wait for it to take 0.5, but otherwise don't needlessly delay it",0
1670,Teresa,Is it like you always want the user to wait at least 0.5s?,0
1670,Jeanett,"I'm thinking, from a UI point of view, I'd rather delay my user for an extra .3s but allow her to see what I'm displaying, instead of having a quasi-instant flash of useless content",0
1670,Teresa,"Right. That sounds rather complicated in terms of logic, but of course can be done once and reused later.",0
1670,Jeanett,but maybe it's an X/Y and y'all have a better solution entirely!,0
1670,Janine,Jeanett: I gave a talk at Remote Elm Meetup (4?) about our animation library that works alongside css transitions (manages the timing),0
1670,Joni,"I'd have a task with a process.sleep 500 * Time.millisecond, and when that's done, check if your model is `NotAskedYet` and if so, bump it to `Loading`. Something like that.",0
1670,Janine,"We also have a case where we set a “showing” flag in our model, then return a `Cmd` that triggers in .5s. When that msg comes back to update, we set “showing” to false",0
1670,Janine,Here’s the gist that went along with the animation talk <https://gist.github.com/coreyhaines/963029ef49f088e41e1b3485e1c794c3>,0
1670,Janine,And this is how we use it to show user alerts (roughly) <https://gist.github.com/coreyhaines/686c48da891d3babcf56daf6e739d629>,0
1670,Janine,I guess one day I could move them to ellie,0
1670,Teresa,"Maybe you need to expand on `RemoteData` to capture ""Well, technically we have the respond and it's a Success, but we still want to show Loading to the user"" :slightly_smiling_face:",0
1670,Vern,You can grab a timestamp on the first message to tell if the time limit had expired when your response comes back. Search for using a GetTimeAndThen msg for an eloquent way of doing that,0
1670,Kerri,"I don’t remember what site was, but the server response was very fast but at UI level they showed “Calculating the best price/travel combination/what ever” to give a sense of a well thought result. :slightly_smiling_face:",0
1670,Jeanett,"thanks for the suggestions; it seems that although it's obvious to me to do that, you don't necessarily think so :smiley: Would you care to elaborate on that? Is it because in the real world, you aren't faced with ""instant"" results?",0
1670,Jeanett,it might be that I'm trying to solve a problem that won't occur to my users,0
1670,Kerri,It’s not your case of course - it’s quite different. The only analogy here is that the server response is too fast for we poor humans. The take away is tha sometimes being just too fast is not optimal from an UX perspective.,0
1670,Mika,My compile times have gone crazy long. elm-make hangs at file 37 (of 42) but how can I find out what file that corresponds to?,0
1670,Graham,I think the standard advice is to look for complex `case...of` if you have sudden build time degradation,0
1670,Graham,take any long `case...of` and replace with Debug.crash and see what effect it has,0
1670,Graham,there is some info on it here <https://evancz.gitbooks.io/functional-programming-in-elm/recursion/tail-call-elimination.html>,0
1670,Vern,Are you missing an n - 1 on the recursion?,0
1670,Graham,I feel your pain - I have the same sort of issue. Hanging out for 0.19 in hope,0
1670,Kerri,I was told it is fixed in 0.19 - hope to recall it correctly,0
1670,Joni,"Jame: `::` evaluates the RHS before the LFS, so yeah, not eligible for tail call elimination",0
1670,Joni,"or, well, rather, it evaluates both before actually consing",0
1670,Jame,"Joni: Hi , thanks. I also come to that conclusion after reading <https://evancz.gitbooks.io/functional-programming-in-elm/recursion/tail-call-elimination.html>. What I'll try is to introduce an extra 'accumulator' argument into the call to refactor the `::` in that call",0
1671,Marketta,Hi. Sorry for my bad eng. Does anybody know about elm 0.19? Activity on github is low and i am worry about it,0
1671,Margit,Marketta: Why are you worried?,0
1671,Margit,See this: <https://github.com/elm-lang/projects/blob/master/roadmap.md>,0
1671,Polly,I think it's a fairly reasonable concern: <https://github.com/elm-lang/elm-compiler/commits/master> - shows no code changes to the compiler at all this year,0
1671,Polly,"oh, my bad",0
1671,Polly,Evan works on the `dev` branch,0
1671,Margit,It’s not a reasonable concern.,0
1671,Margit,There is work constantly going on.,0
1671,Margit,Not all of it is visible.,0
1671,Polly,The reasonable concern is that is not visible,0
1671,Polly,or darkconsul wouldn't have said it,0
1671,Polly,"I don't think it's fair to say ""your concern is not reasonable""",0
1671,Margit,Please read this: <https://github.com/elm-lang/projects/blob/master/roadmap.md#what-is-the-timeline>,0
1671,Polly,I have read that,0
1671,Margit,Please read it again :slightly_smiling_face:,0
1671,Polly,"Oh, now I magically get it",0
1671,Margit,Perfect!,0
1671,Margit,:wink:,0
1671,Polly,"Marketta: Anyway, perhaps have a look at the `dev` branches if you haven't seen them. The mailing list might be a better option to try and get a status update, if you want one",0
1671,Margit,Please don’t do that.,0
1671,Margit,Evan posts status updates _when there are things to report_,0
1671,Polly,But good luck showing roadmap.md to your team lead have them convinced Elm wouldn't be a big risk,0
1671,Margit,You can find these at the elm-dev mailing list.,0
1671,Margit,Asking for further updates is frustrating the process.,0
1671,Margit,"(on elm-dev, you can ask here)",0
1671,Margit,Visible commits and changes only make up a small part of the work that Evan does.,0
1671,Margit,"A lot of it is researching, discussing, and identifying what makes sense to go into the language, and what makes sense to fit together.",0
1671,Margit,"This is how Elm has ended up so nice. Sadly, this is the parts that don’t come across visibly to outsiders.",0
1671,Margit,"Hence, status updates on elm-dev.",0
1671,Polly,Marketta: There ya go,0
1671,Marketta,Thx. Earlier they released versions every half a year. So i hope that 0.19 will be soon),0
1671,Margit,"There is no need to fear: the community is both large and strong, and NoRedInk is a great parent company for Evan to be based at, since it is home to people who love and use Elm every day. If there was a concern, it would be addressed.",0
1671,Polly,I don't think you will be able to expect that,0
1671,Margit,"Marketta: There is no fixed timeline for releases - if you see the document I linked, it will explain why (<https://github.com/elm-lang/projects/blob/master/roadmap.md#what-is-the-timeline>)",0
1671,Mika,My compile times have gone crazy long. elm-make hangs at file 37 (of 42) but how can I find out what file that corresponds to?,0
1671,Margit,"It will be released once there it has be sufficiently ironed out, and the features all fit together in a way that makes sense.",0
1671,Margit,"Mika: , find the ones with the big case statements",0
1671,Mika,"that means ones `case (x. y, z, w, t) of`, correct",0
1671,Mika,?,0
1671,Mika,I don't have any of those as I know it is an issue,0
1671,Margit,``` case x of 1 -&gt; .. 2 -&gt; .. ``` this case statement has 2 branches,0
1671,Mika,or does it also mean long update functions,0
1671,Margit,find the ones which have more than 16ish,0
1671,Margit,"Yeah, update function also counts",0
1671,Margit,e.g if you have 32 constructors for `Msg` then you probably have a giant `case..of` to go with it,0
1671,Mika,is there any way of knowing which file is causing the slowdown (by name),0
1671,Margit,"Not easily, atm",0
1671,Margit,"You can do some things like compiling one file at a time, with your elm-stuff folder already populated and your elmi/elmo for that given file deleted",0
1671,Jeanett,maybe using a CLI tool to find Messages.elm files with over 12 lines and checking manually,0
1671,Marketta,"yes, i saw this. But having a plans and doing smth is a different things) Document it is good, but i want to be shure that all ok. I need to start new big project and i want to use elm. But using in production something, that has version above 1.0, is dangerous imho",0
1671,Margit,Marketta: Elm has been used in production by several companies safely since 0.15 :wink:,0
1671,Marketta,version below 1.0 :slightly_smiling_face:,0
1671,Laraine,pff i'm having trouble underestanding if i can use this: <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/rundis/elm-bootstrap/3.0.0/Bootstrap-Form#group> like this: ``` validationFeedback : Validation.ValidationState -&gt; List (Form.Option Msg) validationFeedback state = case state of Validation.Invalid -&gt; [ Form.groupDanger ] Validation.Valid -&gt; [ Form.groupSuccess ] Validation.NotValidated -&gt; [] ``` the error is: ``` Cannot find type `Form.Option`. `Form` does not expose `Option`. ``` this means what ? because `Form.Option` is not exposed - i can't build my `validationFeedback ` function?,0
1671,Margit,Don’t let the fact that it’s not `1.0` put you off - Elm’s versioning is not semantic versioning.,0
1671,Monica,Margit: It would be nice to have a list of companies that are using elm in production. Do you know of such a list?,0
1671,Margit,"Marketta: Version numbers are just labels, really.",0
1671,Marketta,"ok, thants",0
1671,Marketta,thanks*,0
1671,Margit,"Monica: <http://elm-lang.org/>, but it’s by no means complete at all.",0
1671,Margit,See at the bottom,0
1671,Polly,"yay, my company is there :slightly_smiling_face:",0
1671,Monica,yeah. I knew about that one…would be cool if there was a more complete list. I think I saw,0
1671,Monica,Genaro: tweet or something about some companies he recently found out about using it,0
1671,Jeanett,"Laraine: Form does not expose Option, it's exposed by the specific ""inputs"" apparently",0
1671,Monica,may be helpful for convincing our own employers that elm is something we should be using,0
1671,Margit,"Monica: , the company simply has to tell evan to be added to the list.",0
1671,Mika,"hmm, ok - I might have to give that a try",0
1671,Margit,I personally know of at least ~20 other companies using Elm,0
1671,Jeanett,we're one! ^^,0
1671,Joni,<https://github.com/lpil/elm-companies> &lt;- there's another list here,0
1671,Margit,Some of them sponsored osloelmday: <https://osloelmday.no/>,0
1671,Margit,"And more of them sponsored elmeurope, with the exception of mozilla and google: <https://elmeurope.org/#sprs>",0
1671,Margit,(and efrei),0
1671,Laraine,not it doesn't work: ``` validationFeedback : Validation.ValidationState -&gt; List (Bootstrap.Form.Input.Option Msg) validationFeedback state = case state of Validation.Invalid -&gt; [ Form.groupDanger ] Validation.Valid -&gt; [ Form.groupSuccess ] Validation.NotValidated -&gt; [] ``` ``` Function `group` is expecting the 1st argument to be: List (Bootstrap.Form.Option msg) But it is: List (Input.Option Msg) 54:26 Error Elm The definition of `validationFeedback` does not match its type annotation. ```,0
1671,Joni,"and of course, everyone looking for elm devs in <#C0LUAGWRK|jobs> presumably uses or wants to use elm in prod, too",0
1671,Monica,That’s Awesome! Had no idea that many are using it. If you know of 20 I’m sure there are many more that we don’t even know about,0
1671,Laraine,so we are not talking about the same `Option` - i think `Form` should expose `Option` as well not just the `Form.Input` - then it will work,0
1671,Jeanett,"Marci: Laraine: there seems to be a problem with the library, since the doc of Form points to ""#Option"" but that's nowhere to be found; maybe ask ?",0
1671,Mika,Richard tweeted about Ford recently...,0
1671,Laraine,augustin82: that what i thought. I'm sure he seen this message because you @ him :smile: - i'll use a anonimus function then,0
1671,Kerri,Monica: Recently Ableton has done a nice web app using Elm: <https://learningmusic.ableton.com>,0
1671,Kerri,Fortunately is becoming hard to keep a list of them :slightly_smiling_face:,0
1671,Laraine,means they figured out the audio - audio stuff was a problem in elm for a long time.,0
1671,Kerri,I believe they used Tone.js for that,0

1672,Johnson,"If I am benchmarking a function that takes a list, what is the best practice for generating that list?",1
1672,Johnson,I’m being a little vague on purpose to avoid asking a leading question.,0
1672,Sunny,probably depends on the specifics of the benchmark but I believe there is some fuzzing tools in elm-test,0
1672,Johnson,Should the actual values in the list have a significant impact on the benchmarking results when the functions being compared don’t care about the particulars of the values?,0
1672,Johnson,And the same values are used for both functions for each benchmark run.,0
1672,Johnson,"Basically, I was creating long lists with `List.repeat 0 N`. When I did this, one of the functions beat out the other by a decent amount. Then I changed how I was creating the lists to `List.repeat 5 N`. Now the other function is blowing the original winner out of the water (600% difference!). Clearly, there’s some kind of weird optimization going on with Lists that consist of only zero. Any clues?",0
1672,Polly,"If you're doing exactly that, then you have the arguments the wrong way round",0
1672,Polly,List.repeat 0 n = the empty list,0
1672,Johnson,Polly: :facepalm:. Thanks .,0
1672,Polly,"Been there enough times - at least you had the sense to question it. I usually just commit with ""1 BILLION PERCENT PERFORMANCE INCREASE""",0
1673,Preston,"If you want to key just a single node in Elm (a node that doesn't even have children), do you have to put it inside a ""meaningless"" `div` so that it is the child? It seems that you can only add keys to children. Docs for reference: <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/html/2.0.0/Html-Keyed#node>",0
1673,Joni,correct; keys are _meant_ to disambiguate between children so they don't get mixed up (though I know there are other uses for them :stuck_out_tongue: ),0
1673,Preston,"Joni: Ok, thanks for the confirmation , much appreciated",0
1674,Santa,I wonder how well Elm interops with web components. Does anybody here have any experience with that? It seems that there are quite a lot of nice UI elements.,1
1674,Micheline,Santa: check out this talk: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ar3TakwE8o0>,0
1674,Santa,Checking out...,0
1674,Chrystal,I saw that Elm has union types. I thought the Elm's union types were actually Algebraic Data Types. Can someone explain the difference?,0
1674,Micheline,Chrystal: see this article: <http://blog.jenkster.com/2016/06/functional-mumbo-jumbo-adts.html>,0
1674,Micheline,"There's a lot of terminology around these ""things"" but for the purpose of Elm, ""Union Types"" == ""Algebraic Data Types""",0
1674,Chrystal,Ok I thought so. The article confirms my suspicion,0
1674,Micheline,From the guide section on types (<https://guide.elm-lang.org/types/union_types.html>): &gt; Note: Union types are sometimes called tagged unions. Some communities call them ADTs.,0
1674,Santa,"Micheline: Oh, yeah. That's what actually inspired me. Unfortunately the google map example is currently broken (<https://github.com/rtfeldman/elm-google-maps/issues/1>). I believe the bug is on the component side and there is a workaround.",0
1674,Coy,Santa: <https://github.com/knewter/elm_web_components_playground> is a thing I made,0
1674,Santa,Coy: Thanks .,0
1674,Chrystal,Sure but the generalisation that union types are called ADTs in other languages is not correct. Adt support type variables while union types should not,0
1674,Chrystal,This is according to TAPL,0
1674,Chrystal,(Types and Programming Languages book),0
1674,Santa,"My question leans toward practical experience. I'm looking for an alternative to elm-mdl and want something that ""just works"", so I can focus on business logic. I'd like to avoid being on a constant lookout for workarounds.",0
1674,Coy,"Santa: I've built a production app using polymer/web components and elm. There are a few concerns that the talk mentioned above covers, I think. In general, it ""Just Works"" with a few caveats depending on the components you're using.",0
1674,Santa,"Oh, that's great!",0
1674,Santa,"Did you use a lot of ""of the shelf"" components, or created your own ones?",0
1674,Micheline,"What Elm refers to ""Union Types"" are allowed to have type variables",0
1674,Chrystal,Exactly. They are ADTs,0
1674,Micheline,yes,0
1674,Santa,Coy: The demo you've linked too looks like a great resource. Thanks ! I'll look deeper into it.,0
1674,Chrystal,Wouldn't it be better to call them what they are? I think it would unify a great abstraction common to many other functional languages,0
1674,Genaro,Yeah! Haskell and Idris should get on board with what Elm and F# call them. :wink: <https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/designing-with-types-single-case-dus/>,0
1674,Chrystal,Probably not happening. I'll see if I can convince the F# and Idris people to name them ADTs :smiling_imp:,0
1674,Santa,Coy: That's a great video . I think I'm sold to at least try it. Also very good point about type safety. I guess it should be quite straight forward to make Elm wrappers for these `nodes` and `attributes`.,0
1675,Selina,Hi everyone. I have a problem and it look like this: ``` generateSet : List Question -&gt; Question -&gt; Clip generateSet catalogue current = case catalogue of [] -&gt; Clip Nothing Nothing Nothing x :: [] -&gt; case current of x -&gt; Clip Nothing (Just x) Nothing x :: y :: [] -&gt; case current of x -&gt; Clip Nothing (Just x) (Just y) x :: y :: z :: [] -&gt; case current of x -&gt; Clip Nothing (Just x) (Just y) y -&gt; Clip (Just x) (Just y) (Just z) z -&gt; Clip (Just y) (Just z) Nothing x :: y :: z :: rest -&gt; case current of z -&gt; Clip Nothing Nothing Nothing _ -&gt; generateSet rest current ```,0

1675,Ladonna,:+1:,0
1675,Selina,done :slightly_smiling_face:,0
1675,Ladonna,"so, you can't do this: ``` case ... of x -&gt; ... y -&gt; ... ```",0
1675,Ladonna,because it's going to treat `x` and `y` as variables to bind to,0
1675,Ladonna,"you can't pattern match against the contents of a variable, I'm afraid",0
1675,Selina,"What i want to do is the following. I have a List of Question and want to traverse this list. When I find the current Question I want to resolve with a type Clip, that takes the previous item in the list, the current and the next one…",0

1675,Selina,hmmm…,0
1675,Selina,may be with if…then statements?,0
1675,Ladonna,lemme read your high level description and see what we can come up with,0
1675,Ladonna,"so, one thing that jumps out at me:",0
1675,Ladonna,"you have no guarantee (that the compiler can offer, anyway) that `current` is in `catalogue`",0
1675,Micheline,It sounds like you may want a zip list?,0
1675,Selina,well it should be in there… but who knows…,0
1675,Selina,"Micheline: hmm… zip list means putting two list like a zipper together, or?",0
1675,Micheline,It's list that keeps track of it's currently focused element,0
1675,Micheline,"you can move the ""cursor"" forwards and backwards",0
1675,Selina,hmmm… sounds interesting… maybe this is what i am searching for.,0
1675,Selina,"I think of a List of items and a kind of magnifying glass that traverses over the list. And all I see through that glass is the previous, the current and the next item…",0

1675,Leonard,It uses <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/wernerdegroot/listzipper/latest> which implements a zipper already.,0
1675,Selina,"Liberty: Leonard: thanks… That looks easy with that package. I still have to think about approach.. Still do not get it ceompletely, but want to… I have to think a bout that…",0
1675,Micheline,Liberty: The approach is what that `List.Zipper` package implements,0
1675,Leonard,"The big difference between that library and the data structure above is that the custom one always has 3 (or more) elements and can never focus on the very head or tail, but you don't have `Maybe` results.",0
1675,Liberty,"so, if this kind of pattern match is something you will do in many locations, and your structures is only valid with 3+ elemens, it may be worth it to write a custom data structure. Otherwise the package is probably easier",0
1675,Selina,Ok. Thanks everybody for that. That is awesone input I got. Trying to understand this and will have a look into the List.Zipper implementation. Will come back if I dont understand it :wink: Thanks :slightly_smiling_face:,0

1675,Micheline,The section on zip lists starts at 11:20 but the whole video is worth watching :100:,0
1675,Leonard,I should polish up this empty-list-zipper I wrote and publish it.,0
1675,Selina,I watched this video once and was huge to me… but I totally forgot that Richard did address this problem exactly :smile:,0

1676,Taunya,"That elm-console library above _used_ to do something like this, but it's pre-Signal-elimination.",0

1677,Susanne,Hello folks! Is anyone aware of a pure elm way to make tooltips? Something like in bootsrap.,1

1678,Daniell,"Genaro: In the elm-spa-example mentions that most of the Main.elm would go away in Elm 0.19 . I'm curious what would go away, and maybe if we could help in the process. any idea where should i be looking :smile:",0

1678,Joni,"so one of the features that's being considered for 0.19 is code splitting - a separate, minimal bundle per route. To enable that, routing and the concept of ""pages"" will become a first-level concept in Elm, most likely to be configured through a new type of `elm-package.json`. This should take care of routing, bundling, code splitting, and handling the boilerplate that's currently involved in managing SPA's",0

1682,Jeanett,"hey, so I've just noticed that I'm suffering badly from the Elm compiler using too many CPUs when building (<https://github.com/elm-lang/elm-make/issues/159>)",0
1682,Jeanett,"building and using sysconfcpus (`sysconfcpus -n 1`) works, but I'm not sure how to do it with our webpack scripts",0
1682,Jeanett,anyone encountered (and preferably solved ;)) this issue?,0
1682,Margit,Yes,0
1682,Margit,Just call webpack with sysconfcpus,0
1682,Jeanett,of course,0
1682,Margit,`sysconfcpus -n 1 webpack`,0

1682,Jeanett,"thanks Noah, sorry about that",0
1682,Susanne,"What is the best way to represent relational data in Elm? For example I do have two rest endpoints which I can use to fetch user and posts. Within user response I will get list of ids of posts of the user. Then I need to do separate requests to fetch each post. ``` user = { id : '123', posts: ['456', '789'] } post = { id: '456', text: 'hello world' } ``` Also I am using `RemoteData` to represent data which comes from the server.",0
1682,Alicia,"Susanne: not sure about ""best"" since that's a loaded term, but how would you plan to simply store the list of posts?",0
1682,Susanne,That’s one of the questions. Ideally I would expect it to be something along the lines of `List (RemoteData Post)` since I’d like to be able to handle errors/loading states separately for each post.,0
1682,Alicia,Have you considered a `Dict Int Post`? Those can be advantageous when we have a bag of things like posts which might be dynamically loading or disappearing and for which we want to search by an id,0
1682,Alicia,Or even `Dict Int (RemoteData Post)` in your case,0
1682,Hertha,I have `Dict String (RemoteData ...)` in one of my projects,0
1682,Hertha,it works well,0
1682,Susanne,"Could you, please, write types for User and Post as you would do in your Elm code?",0
1682,Alicia,"That may depend on how many posts a user might have, but here is one option",0
1682,Susanne,"The part I am more interesting about is how to handle relations within data, since originally you get fields as id’s",0
1682,Joni,"One option is to represent it very much like you wrote it before: `type alias User = { id : Int, posts : List Int }` and have a `Dict Int (RemoteData Post)` where you can look up those posts for displaying",0
1682,Alicia,"``` type alias User = { id: Int , posts: List Int } type alias Post = { id: Int , content : String } type alias Posts = Dict Int (RemiteData Post) ```",0
1682,Susanne,"Ok, I see. Is there a way to use it “inline”.",0
1682,Susanne,So If I have multiple users in my model I do not have to store all their posts in one `Dict`. This is due to skip cache invalidation problems.,0
1682,Hertha,You can have `posts` be a `List (RemoteData Post)` in `User`,0
1682,Hertha,"but that won’t work, you’d need the id, so you probably want `List (Int, RemoteData Post)`",0
1682,Hertha,or `String` as it seems your ids are strings,0
1682,Hertha,it depends on what you actually want,0
1682,Susanne,"Ok, that seems reasonable. Thank you :slightly_smiling_face:",0
1682,Alicia,You can do the dict online too,0
1682,Alicia,And I would recommend converting to an Int id on load to remove that ambiguity,0
1682,Susanne,"Well, I can’t really convert it, because I have multiple relations in my “User” alternative. And `Task` do not provide any way to make requests in parallel.",0
1682,Alicia,"Susanne: what do you mean that you cannot convert it? also, why can you not make requests in parallel?",0
1682,Susanne,Alicia: there is no `Task.parallel`. What I mean is that I’d be able to fetch all the data at once in the `Task` chain and then I don’t need to store ids somewhere.,0
1682,Alicia,"do you mean parallel or sequential, like, get the user and then get all of the posts the user request referenced?",0
1682,Alicia,"or, get these three things all at the same starting point",0
1682,Susanne,"In this case they are sequential, but in case user have posts and friends then I want all requests for posts and friends be parallel",0
1682,Susanne,However I’ve already implemented things as tuples and it works more or less nice :slightly_smiling_face:,0
1682,Alicia,not sure Elm blocks you from doing that. We have `Task.andThen` to work with those data-sequential requests and `Cmd.batch` to dispatch multiple tasks at once,0
1682,Susanne,Cmd do not have `andThen` so I can’t transform data inside task chains. I have to go through update with them. In this case I either have to store ids somewhere or have two different types for `User`.,0
1682,Alicia,"you don’t need to store those ids though, you can pass them along in a new task",0
1682,Susanne,This is basically continuation of &gt; What I mean is that I’d be able to fetch all the data at once in the `Task` chain and then I don’t need to store ids somewhere.,0
1682,Susanne,So with current `Task` API it seems to be impossible for me,0
1682,Susanne,But I do it through update and it seems fine,0
1682,Susanne,So no big worries,0
1682,Alicia,"so something like… ``` getUser : UserId -&gt; Task String User ``` becomes ``` getUser : UserId -&gt; Task String (User, Cmd msg) ```",0
1682,Alicia,"and then… ``` getUser |&gt; andThen (\user -&gt; (user, getPosts user.postIds) ) ```",0
1682,Daniell,i do something like `Task.map2 (\posts friends -&gt; updateModel posts friends) Data.getPosts Data.getFriends` not sure if they are parallel or not. never thought of that,0
1682,Daniell,Alicia: ^,0
1682,Joni,they're not,0
1682,Alicia,"but you may be hitting an intrinsic semantic question (leading to needing to deal with it in update) - is there ever a time when you want to get the user but not the posts? if they are always together, is there a reason not to just handle it in the update function? or, maybe that’s the question: what is it that leads you to not want to deal with it in the update function?",0
1682,Susanne,"Yeah, they are not :slightly_smiling_face:",0
1682,Daniell,dang! good to know :smile:,0
1682,Daniell,i always thought the Tasks were just sent off one after the other without waiting for the results,0
1683,Susanne,Is there a way to pattern match on list field inside record which is inside union type tag? Something like: ``` Just { list = x :: xs } -&gt; ```,0
1683,Jeanett,"I don't think you can pattern match on Records, no",0
1683,Hertha,"depending on your other matches, you can match on something like `case Maybe.map .list x of x :: xs -&gt; ` though",0
1683,Hertha,"I sometimes do things like this to reduce duplication in `case`: ``` case (someFun x, someOtherFun x) of ```",0
1683,Jeanett,"it's a nice, handy trick, indeed",0
1683,Hertha,"but it would be great with more expressive case patterns, although i see the implementation problems with detecting missing cases etc.",0

1685,Wes,can anyone help me understand the difference between `Html.Lazy` and `Html.Keyed` and when to use them?,0
1685,Margit,lazy is to reduce render time. Keyed is to make rendering more consistent.,0
1685,Margit,Use lazy when your views are slow to render. This will be rarely.,0
1685,Margit,"Use keyed when you have lists of items, e.g in an `select`, to help Elm’s virtual-dom render things in the right way.",0
1685,Margit,"This will also be rarely, but it depends a lot on your view.",0
1685,Wes,"so if for example I have a list of 100 items that can be filtered based on an input field, will keyed help speed up rendering the filtered nodes?",0
1685,Jospeh,How to insert HTML into Elm? I have to do that because some chunks of HTML code comes from the database. I tried to follow this article <https://www.reddit.com/r/elm/comments/49w48m/inserting_html_from_api/> but Elm complains it cannot find VirtualDom package…,0
1685,Margit,"Yes. But benchmark, always benchmark",0
1685,Wes,"great, thanks noah",0
1685,Jospeh,"found another solution at <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/elm-discuss/icpKL-AgRlg>, checking…",0
1685,Margit,Jospeh: you have to install virtualdom,0
1685,Margit,`elm-package install elm-lang/virtualdom`,0
1685,Joni,<https://ellie-app.com/3x9wfvL5DKVa1/0> and then use it something like this,0
1685,Janine,Jospeh: I use `Markdown.toHtml` to insert html,0
1685,Jospeh,"Margit: I don’t need it. This works: ```module DangerousHtml exposing (innerHtml) import Html exposing (Html, span) import Html.Attributes exposing (property) import Json.Encode exposing (string) innerHtml : String -&gt; Html msg innerHtml dangerousHtml = span [ property ""innerHTML"" &lt;| string dangerousHtml ] []```",0
1685,Janine,"I ran into problems with `innerHTML`, as it didn’t seem Elm tracked changes to it. While using `Markdown.toHtml` creates actual virtual dom nodes.",0
1685,Janine,<http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/evancz/elm-markdown/3.0.2/Markdown>,0
1685,Jospeh,But I don’t have the source in the MarkDown format. It’s HTML.,0
1685,Janine,HTML is markdown,0
1685,Jospeh,"hehe, right :slightly_smiling_face:",0
1685,Janine,:slightly_smiling_face:,0
1685,Jospeh,more or less,0
1685,Janine,"I use this in several places in my app (across two products), and it works great",0
1685,Janine,"And since it creates vdom nodes, elm can use it effectively for diffing and rendering",0
1685,Jospeh,"I have `&lt;a href=""foo""&gt;bar&lt;/a&gt;` inside. AFAIK, Markdown uses a different syntax`[foor](bar)`",0
1685,Janine,"No, that works",0
1685,Janine,Html is a subset of markdown,0
1685,Janine,"So, `Markdown.toHtml [] ""&lt;a href=""foo""&gt;bar&lt;/a&gt;""` will yield `&lt;a href=""foo""&gt;bar&lt;/a&gt;`",0
1685,Janine,"In fact, if you want to add things, such as `target` to the link, you have to use the html form, not the `[foo](bar)` form (with standard Markdown parsers, that is)",0
1685,Janine,"Also, using `Markdown.toHtml` means you can pass in the sanitize option, if you want.",0
1685,Jospeh,"Janine: it does not work. My HTML is always escaped whatever `sanitize` value I use :disappointed: I changed my code into ``` module DangerousHtml exposing (dangerousHtml) import Html exposing (Html) import Markdown exposing (Options, defaultOptions, toHtmlWith) options : Options options = { defaultOptions | sanitize = False } dangerousHtml : String -&gt; Html msg dangerousHtml userInput = Markdown.toHtmlWith options [] userInput ```",0
1685,Jospeh,Markdown also wraps my html into `&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;myhtml&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;`. I don’t want it.,0
1685,Cassy,May be there is some indentation. If you use python you can call `textwrap.dedent()` on the html before handing it to client.,0
1685,Janine,"Jospeh: interesting. I’ve not run into that. I’d say try it without the options, which is what we tend to use. Just `Markdown.toHtml`",0
1685,Janine,"Yeah, I think indentation will hurt, too.",0
1685,Jospeh,What is textwrap.dedent? Which package?,0
1685,Jospeh,I don’t use Python. OK. I will fix it somehow.,0
1685,Jospeh,works. cool,0
1685,Janine,Jospeh: it was the indentation?,0

1686,Margit,Beckie: yes,0
1686,Beckie,Margit: whats the correct way to then call by decoder on the data then?,0
1686,Margit,`Json.Decode.decodeValue`,0
1686,Beckie,do you know of any examples of flags/json decoding,0
1686,Margit,Do you just not know how to use a decoder?,0
1686,Margit,Or is the flag part?,0
1686,Beckie,"flag part, I have a decoder",0
1686,Beckie,just want to know how to pass my flag json into the decoder,0
1686,Margit,"so, you have a function which is like this: `init : Json.Value -&gt; (Model, Cmd Msg)`",0
1686,Margit,then that wants to look something like this:,0
1686,Margit,"``` init value = case Json.Decode.decodeValue myDecoder value of Err e -&gt; some error model Ok actualModel -&gt; (model, Cmd.none) ```",0
1686,Margit,where `myDecoder` is the decoder that you have.,0

E.g., if ""chlorophyll"" ranges from 0-100 for all samples in the db but then only from 0.5-2.3 for the subset returned, I will want to show that to the users as a pair of min/max inputs. Likewise, the ""Longhurst province"" might just be a subset of 2-3 string values, in which case I'd construct a multi-select.",0
1690,Elnora,"Looking at Json.Decode.oneOf, it looks like I'd have to coerce everything to a string?",0
1690,Sunny,no,0
1690,Sunny,"do you need to recurse, as in some of your keys contain dicts or are you fine with strings and ints",0
1690,Elnora,Strings and numbers (ints and floats) are fine.,0
1690,Elnora,I should actually remove that one dict/object as it's the key from Mongo,0
1690,Sunny,"``` type Type = StrType String | IntType Int | ValueType Dec.Value decoder : Dec.Decoder (Dict.Dict String Type) decoder = [Dec.string |&gt; Dec.map StrType, <http://Dec.int|Dec.int> |&gt; Dec.map IntType, Dec.value |&gt; Dec.map ValueType] |&gt; Dec.oneOf |&gt; Dec.dict ``` something like this then",0
1690,Sunny,Theres probably a way to structure this without the `ValueType` so that it just omits the key if it's not an int or string,0
1690,Elnora,Thanks! I'm trying to work this into my code and understand all the implications.,0
1690,Sunny,If you want to store two different types in a Dict then you need an alternation that allows you check whats stored,0
1690,Elnora,"Sunny: It took me a bit to fix all my types, but, true to form, when it compiled it, Elm worked and gave me what I wanted!",0
1690,Elnora,"I'm still unsure what the ""ValueType"" holds. Is this a catch-all for things that aren't strings or ints?",0
1690,Elnora,I'm seeing my floats are wrapped as ValueType.,0
1690,Sunny,"yeah, its going to decode as a Json.Value",0
1690,Sunny,which is a generic container for json stuff,0
1690,Sunny,you could also probably do something this Maybe types,0
1690,Elnora,"Cool, I just added FloatType and it worked.",0
1690,Sunny,"If you don't like the values then you can do something like this ``` type Type = StrType String | IntType Int | FloatType Float decoder : Dec.Decoder (Dict.Dict String Type) decoder = [ Dec.string |&gt; Dec.map (StrType &gt;&gt; Just) , <http://Dec.int|Dec.int> |&gt; Dec.map (IntType &gt;&gt; Just) , Dec.float |&gt; Dec.map (FloatType &gt;&gt; Just) , Dec.succeed Nothing ] |&gt; Dec.oneOf |&gt; Dec.keyValuePairs |&gt; Dec.map (List.filterMap (\( n, v ) -&gt; Maybe.map (\x -&gt; ( n, x )) v)) |&gt; Dec.map Dict.fromList ```",0

1692,Letitia,Anyone got a good trick for moving all your Elm modules under a new namespace? i.e. ``` ModuleA =&gt; NewNamespace.ModuleA ModuleB =&gt; NewNamespace.ModuleB ```,1
1693,Anibal,"This is not elm-specific, but im throwing it out here: I realize again and again that I'm exceptionally terrible at web design.

1693,Daniell,yeah! sometimes i wish modules could be relatively namespaced based on the folder they were in. That'd be cool,0
1693,Letitia,When the elm-format AST is ready we should be able to put together a tool for applying refactorings like this.,0
1694,Ranae,what to expect from 0.19 version?,0
1694,Ivey,<https://github.com/elm-lang/projects/blob/master/roadmap.md>,0
1694,Ivey,The major focus of 0.19 will be creating “single-page apps” in Elm. The features that fall under that umbrella include: - Server-side rendering — sending HTML with the initial response - Tree shaking — trimming out unused code (usually called dead-code elimination or DCE) - Code splitting — cutting up code into smaller chunks for better caching - Lazy loading — only sending the code chunks needed for a particular page,0
1695,Jospeh,Is there any Elm module for using media queries?,0
1695,Jospeh,Something like <https://www.npmjs.com/package/match-media>,0
1695,Liberty,"Jospeh: not directly, but style-elements has something like it <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/mdgriffith/style-elements/3.1.0/Element#classifyDevice>, uses a subscription to catch scaling and such, parses it into a nice record that you can base whatever on.",0
1695,Liberty,you can probably replicate that,0
1695,Daniell,0.19 is probably a little far off in the future. or is it coming soon?,0

1696,Rolf,But it seems that using elm make to make the js.file and loading it off my HDD (how it has to work in a photoshop plugin) tries to load the obj file as a html file and so it breaks the parsing,0
1696,Rolf,Is there something i have to put in to make sure it actually loads in properly?,0
1696,Liberty,how is the file loaded ? are you using some webserver?,0
1696,Rolf,no,0

1696,Rolf,<https://github.com/Zinggi/elm-obj-loader/blob/master/src/OBJ.elm>,0

1700,Shaun,"Is it safe to say that everything in Elm is a function? So if i declare a ""variable/constant"" `ten = 10` is `ten` than a function of a value?",0
1700,Liberty,you can think of constants as zero-argument functions,0
1700,Liberty,"so all elm values can be thought of as functions, if that helps",0
1700,Shaun,Liberty: Alright thank you,0
1700,Hertha,Shaun: i think it depends on why you want to call it a function. mathematically it’s not a function,0
1700,Liberty,"but any value of type `a` is isomorphic to a function `() -&gt; a` (in the sense that they contain the same amount of information). So, there is some theoretical base for considering them the same.",0
1700,Hertha,"Sure. As I said, it depends on why you want to call it a function. There is a useful distinction in Elm between values and functions, values being the end result of applying functions, where you can’t apply anything anymore.",0
1700,Otto,Thought y'all might enjoy <https://twitter.com/mrb_bk/status/877558038030372869>,0

1701,Earlean,"I made a new package : <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/FabienHenon/elm-infinite-list-view/latest> . It's about rendering infinite lists, by displaying only visible elements. Feedback appreciated :slightly_smiling_face:",0
1702,Bryan,"Has anyone had any experience with contentEditable divs? More specifically, in binding the value of the div to some content. It appears that whenever the value of the content is updated, the cursor moves to the beginning of the input element, meaning that you'd be typing in reverse. This seems to happen whether you set the value with Html.text or if you set the innerHTML directly from Html.Attributes.property. Has anyone else experienced this, or worked around it? I'm trying to avoid porting out to JS if possible.",0
1702,Phillis,Bryan: I tried using one of those for a while and gave up on it.,0
1702,Phillis,"If you insist on using contentEditable, I’d recommend just catching the `input` events in JS and forwarding the current value through to Elm on a port.",0
1702,Phillis,This kind of thing is a known issue with virtual-dom based renderers.,0
1702,Phillis,"Basically, the element is being re-created and the editing state (such as where the cursor is) is lost.",0
1702,Phillis,You might be able to deal with it somewhat with `Html.Keyed.node`.,0
1702,Phillis,I hadn’t seen this until after I moved on to the JS side.,0
1702,Bryan,"oh, cool. That's a good idea. Let me experiment with that",0
1702,Bryan,"Basically, I'm trying to build a WYSIWG type of editor, but a requirement is the formatted text has to be inside the editor, ala TinyMCE kind of thing. I tried to pitch a different div sort of like <http://Stackedit.io|Stackedit.io>, but no luck :stuck_out_tongue:",0
1702,Bryan,Thanks for your help.,0
1702,Shaun,Lady: aha is that not possible because it get executed on declaration and thereby you can not call `undefined` as a function?,0
1702,Lady,:point_up: correct,0
1702,Lady,"because it's compiled as a variable, not a function",0
1702,Shaun,Lady: Hertha: Liberty: Thanks that all makes sense,0
1702,Shaun,So it is better to label `ten` in `ten = 10` as a Value,0
1702,Shaun,With the distinction between value and function is that you fully applied all the arguments,0
1702,Lady,"It's correct to call it a value. I'd call it a ""constant"" because it is a value that can never change.",0
1702,Lady,"in another language, `ten = 10` might be called an assignment or a variable declaration; in Elm it's actually a declaration of equivalency. `ten` is ALWAYS equal to the value `10`.",0
1702,Shaun,Alright thanks! :slightly_smiling_face:,0
1702,Joni,"To be complete - Elm is strict, which means that expressions are evaluated as soon as all arguments are available. Say I have a function `foo : a -&gt; b -&gt; c -&gt; d`. That's clearly a function. If I define that function as `foo = Debug.crash ""buh bye!""`, though, and have that in a top-level value, your program will still crash before even starting.",0
1702,Margit,Unless you use a let binding.,0
1702,Margit,"In which case, it will crash on evaluation of the function",0
1702,Margit,"Same goes for if you wrap something in a case statement, or an if statement.",0
1702,Shaun,Joni: ohw nice i did not know that is what strict mend. Useful thanks,0
1702,Joni,"it's also where the subtle difference between `always ""foo""` and `(\_ -&gt; ""foo"")` comes in",0

1702,Sunny,"yeah, regex... so infuriating",0
1702,Margit,Elnora: Use an if statement + `Dict.empty`,0
1702,Joni,"or `case Dict.toList myDict of [] -&gt; ""empty!""` (though, if it's not empty, that's a waste)",0
1702,Sunny,"Margit: you list function equality as a runtime crash, but shouldn't (wouldn't) the compiler catch that?",0
1702,Elnora,``` case List.length (Dict.keys optionList) of 0 -&gt; ... _ -&gt; ... ```,0
1702,Joni,could just match on `Dict.size` in that case :slightly_smiling_face:,0
1702,Joni,"Sunny: it could, I suppose, if there were another pseudo-typeclass `equatable` or something like that, which would be ""any value except functions, json-encode values, and possibly some others"".",0
1702,Elnora,Joni: I didn't know about Dict.size. Thanks!,0
1702,Lavonna,"If all you need from size is if it's 0 or something else, use `isEmpty` &amp; and if/then like eeue56 said",0
1702,Lavonna,Otherwise you're traversing the whole dict,0
1702,Elnora,"Margit: I tried `isEmpty` the other day, and it matched in all cases. Or something like that. helped me with it. In this particular case, I'll need the keys anyway, so I can get them in a ""let"" .",0
1702,Elnora,"The REPL doesn't like this: ```[first, rest] = split ""__"" ""foo__bar_baz""```",0
1702,Sunny,"Joni: umm why would you need that. If functions aren't comparable, they aren't comparable. Just don't define (==) for function types",0
1702,Sunny,"nvm, I got what your saying",0
1702,Elnora,"Variations with `()` and nothing fail, too.",0
1702,Sunny,but comparable is a thing?,0
1702,Joni,yep,0
1702,Sunny,or is comparable considered to have an ordering,0
1702,Micheline,comparable is if something is greater than or less than something else,0
1702,Elnora,"`first :: rest = split ""__"" ""foo__bar_baz""`",0
1702,Joni,"`comparable`, `number` and `appendable`, but they're explained in the faq better than I can do so here :slightly_smiling_face:",0
1702,Sunny,"hmm, so the Dict requirement of comparable is overkill infact",0
1702,Joni,"no, it's required because the keys need to be compared to get a balanced tree",0
1702,Joni,which is how you get the fast lookups sorted out :slightly_smiling_face:,0
1702,Micheline,That's why you can't use union types as Dict keys because they aren't comparable (for now),0
1702,Sunny,well I know they don't implement comparable,0
1702,Lavonna,"Elnora: All the compiler knows is split returns a List, it doesn't know it can't be empty, so you have to handle the empty case as well",0
1702,Elnora,"OK, I'm seeing that.",0
1702,Elnora,I would have been tempted to try `Regex` but now I know not to. :slightly_smiling_face:,0
1702,Sunny,"so dicts are an ordered map then, because a general dict implementation it would need to simply be hashable",0
1702,Joni,"Sunny: they're all compiler-supported _special_ type variables, though, more than actual typeclasses. I.e. you can use them as a prefix in a typesignature to say sometihng about the types you expect - `mapKeys : (comparable1 -&gt; comparable2) -&gt; Dict comparable1 v -&gt; Dict comparable2 v`",0
1702,Sunny,I'm more or less familiar with them (have used them).,0
1702,Sunny,Just a curiousity because a balanced tree has logN look ups as opposed to a hash tables constant time,0
1702,Sunny,"Nothing I've dealt with is big enough for that to be really relavent, and if it was it probably shouldn't be in a browser so...",0
1702,Joni,"Yeah, Array's are a little closer to what you mean (hash array mapped tries with buckets of 32 elements, or at least that's what they'll become soon enough).",0
1702,Hector,"Which is the best Elm-UI framework to use? Bootstrap, MDL, Polymer...?",0

1704,Maxima,Find : (a -&gt; Bool) -&gt; Array a -&gt; Maybe a,0

1704,Margit,"Ah, right",0
1704,Maxima,I could hear if Evan is open to adding such a fn to core.,0
1704,Laraine,set instead of array? I thought that in sets is not allowed to have duplicate elements - and in array one can have duplicate elements. Is this actually false?,0
1704,Margit,"No, you're right",0
1704,Margit,What robin means is that sets can implement `member` in like O(log(n))ish,0

1705,Victor,"iirc, there are not many good ways around that (sub second issue), you may want to wait until the first tick and then start counting down.",0
1705,Merrill,"Victor: hmm yeah I was heading towards that solution, was just hoping for something more elegant",0
1705,Merrill,there is this... <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/simonewebdesign/elm-timer/latest>,0
1705,Norma,"the suggestion for Process.sleep should work, it isn’t based on the system time but rather a unit of time",0
1705,Merrill,"Norma: I'll have a look into it, may do the job",0
1705,Norma,"hey… whadya know, i have done this already… <https://github.com/mordrax/cotwelm/blob/b72efbb428a6d190ff8a8a9ba61638efa2b8e89e/src/Arena/PlayerArena.elm#L80>",0
1705,Norma,~hits it every~ waits for 150ms,0
1705,Merrill,"sweet, I'll have a dig into it. I've only been using Elm for a week or two, so still getting my head around it",0
1705,Norma,"ah yeah, wouldn’t suggest you look too deep into that code… i don’t know what i was on when writing that, just how it’s called and threaded back into the Cmd. ianmackenzie is on the ball with `Process.sleep 10000`",0
1705,Merrill,yeah I can't say I quite fully understand what that one line is doing exactly,0
1705,Merrill,is it basically sleeping the update function for 150ms?,0
1705,Norma,"haha, ok so you’ve got: <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/5.1.1/Process#sleep> that takes in a `Time` and gives out a `Task` then you’ve got to perform that task <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/5.1.1/Task#perform> which performs a task, and gives you back a msg ( you provide the `a -&gt; msg` function",0
1705,Merrill,"ah right yeah, I see what's happening, you're then passing the message `Sleep (asyncCmd match matches resetCounter) resetCounter`",0
1705,Norma,so all i’m doing here: ``` Task.perform (\_ -&gt; Sleep (asyncCmd match matches resetCounter) resetCounter) (Process.sleep 150) -- summarises to Task.perform (\unused_ -&gt; msg) (Process.sleep 150) ```,0
1705,Merrill,which is then caught `Sleep cmd resetCounter -&gt;`,0
1705,Norma,"exactly, the `msg -&gt; Sleep ...`",0
1705,Norma,"so chuck whatever you want to do into that first function `(\unused_ -&gt; msg)`, then thread the output of the Task.peform which is a cmd into your update’s output (<https://github.com/mordrax/cotwelm/blob/b72efbb428a6d190ff8a8a9ba61638efa2b8e89e/src/Arena/PlayerArena.elm#L103>), then you’ve got your msg",0
1705,Norma,"There is a purpose to all this madness! See Elm is declarative. Process.sleep doesn’t actually sleep, Task.perform doesn’t actually perform anything. They are all just declaring that, they will do something. You’ll find this with Generators, Decoders, pretty much everything!!!",0
1705,Norma,"All these functions are pure, meaning they have no side effects, meaning they don’t do anything. O_O! So unlike in imperative languages where you go sleep 150 and expect it to sleep, here, Process.sleep 150 just gives back a Task that *will* sleep. Then it’s up to you when you call it.",0
1705,Norma,It’s only when you hook up all your declarative functions to the program’s subscription that then allows elm to drive effects through your app,0
1705,Merrill,it's definitely something to wrap your head around! but I'm honestly enjoying it,0
1705,Merrill,"just having a look at how I would hook this up in my code, does something like this make sense?",0
1705,Merrill,"``` StartGame -&gt; ( { model | status = Playing }, Task.perform (\_ -&gt; Tick) (Process.sleep 1000) ) ```",0
1705,Norma,that should trigger your Tick process ~1000ms after a StartGame msg comes through,0
1705,Merrill,I know in this situation I'm expecting that Tick will only be called once after 1000ms,0
1705,Merrill,"alright, the compiler is having a fit haha.",0
1705,Norma,I say roughly because js has a error margin with setTimeout of &lt; 8ms i think…,0
1705,Norma,"if you can’t work it out, chuck the msg here and the community will help, according to some we’re ‘excessively’ helpful",0
1705,Norma,"actually that is true, last time, i needed a foldl which reduced a Result, and got 3 answers in just as many minutes",0
1705,Merrill,"sure, incoming...",0
1705,Merrill,"``` The 1st and 2nd branches of this `case` produce different types of values. 12| case msg of 13| Clicked -&gt; 14| if model.status == Playing then 15| processClick model 16| else 17| ( model, Cmd.none ) 18| 19| StartGame -&gt; 20|&gt; ( { model | status = Playing }, Task.perform (\_ -&gt; Tick) (Process.sleep 1000) ) 21| 22| Tick _ -&gt; 23| updateTime model The 1st branch has this type: ( { click_count : Int , click_limit : Int , points : Int , status : Status , targets : List Target , time_elapsed : Int , time_limit : Int } , Cmd (Msg) ) But the 2nd is: ( { click_count : Int , click_limit : Int , points : Int , status : Status , targets : List Target , time_elapsed : Int , time_limit : Int } , Cmd (Time.Time -&gt; Msg) ) ```",0
1705,Norma,"Your Tick tag doens’t have a value, but your update function is expecting one",0
1705,Norma,change ln 22: `Tick -&gt;`,0
1705,Merrill,ah brilliant! good spot :slightly_smiling_face:,0
1705,Merrill,that was leftover crud from when I was using `Time.every second Tick`,0
1705,Norma,"yes, you can pass values along with the tick if you want and that’s how you’d do it",0
1705,Norma,`(\_ -&gt; Tick valueToUpdateInASecond)`,0

I'd like it if it was possible to have only the Elm runtime as one file, and the remaining apps as their own file.

1717,Jeanett,"yup, I agree with that kind of reasoning; I was just thinking it should be easy to share the Elm runtime as a side-dependency",0
1717,Joni,"Yeah, I don't think that can be (easily) done",0
1717,Jeanett,I'm probably not good enough to understand why ^^,0
1717,Margit,"It can be done, but right now you will be fighting more than you are achieving.",0
1717,Margit,I _suspect_ that this is what is coming with 0.19.,0
1717,Tambra,:wave:,0
1717,Jeanett,Joni: Margit: thanks and,0
1718,Janita,does anyone know what the most elegant way is to conditionally render an attribute in elm?,1
1718,Janita,"with html you can just do `if someBool then p [] [] else text """"`. what is the equivalent for attributes?",0
1718,Jeanett,what we do is append to a list,0
1718,Janita,yeah that's why I asked for the most elegant way. That was the only one I could come up with and it not that nice to use. :confused:,0
1718,Jeanett,"so something like ``` let attrsForAll = [ onClick Bleh ] conditionalAttrs = if (cond) then [ class ""condIsTrue"" ] else [] in div (attrsForAll ++ conditionalAttrs) []```",0
1718,Jeanett,what do you think is not nice about it?,0
1718,Janita,I was hoping for a shorter solution. But I guess that's the only way to do it.,0
1718,Margit,"`none = attribute """" """"`",0
1718,Margit,"`if someBool then none else class ""hello""`",0
1718,Janita,ah that's nice,0
1718,Janita,that's the shorty I was looking for :slightly_smiling_face:,0
1718,Janita,Margit: Jeanett: thank you and,0
1718,Joni,I think that'll blow up,0
1718,Joni,"empty string isn't a valid attribute name, so the eventual `setAttrbute` would blow up",0
1718,Joni,"try something non-sensical like `none = attribute ""foo"" """"` which... shouldn't blow up",0
1718,Joni,<https://ellie-app.com/3yrYYJzM6mVa1/0> for example,0
1718,Margit,"Yes, or `data-foo`",0
1718,Margit,<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Howto/Use_data_attributes>,0
1718,Joni,"oh yeah, that's probably safer even",0
1718,Janita,yeah it does blow up `ncaught DOMException: Failed to execute 'setAttribute' on 'Element': '' is not a valid attribute name.`,0
1718,Margit,Yep,0
1718,Janita,so I guess appending to the list is what I will use,0
1718,Margit,Hm?,0
1718,Margit,"`none = attribute ""data-foo"" """"`",0
1718,Jeanett,"Janita: using ""data-foo"" will not blow up",0
1718,Margit,this will work,0
1718,Jeanett,it'll remain shorter if you have one conditional attribute,0
1718,Jeanett,"I checked in Ellie, and it seems it's OK to have several of the same attributes in the Elm code",0
1718,Joni,"they'll just override, last one wins",0
1718,Joni,(except for `style` and `class` which get special treatment),0
1718,Jeanett,they do?,0
1718,Jeanett,don't tell me they add up automatically?,0
1718,Joni,they do,0
1718,Jeanett,"all that time wasted manually doing something that other, more clever people, did for me... ^^",0
1718,Margit,"It doesn’t require intelligence, it requires the ability to modify the internals of the virtual-dom :stuck_out_tongue:",0
1718,Santa,"Ok, done: <https://github.com/elm-lang/error-message-catalog/issues/223>",0
1718,Santa,Margit: Thanks for help,0
1718,Lady,dawehner: you mean `elm-jsonapi`?,0
1718,Janita,Jeanett: Joni: Margit: that was actuaaly The first time ever i caused a runtime error in elm. :-) Crazy that getting errors in Elm seems so weird where in js it happens all the time. Those solutions will get me where I need to go. Thank you.,0
1718,Dominica,I totally do. It's far more complete than many other things I've seen out there. For me at least though I'm wondering whether inlining those includes in the first place might be the better solution,0
1718,Mika,"but it complains debug is missing, rather than just giving me `Nothing` as I had hoped",0
1718,Margit,You can bring flags in as json and decode them,0
1718,Mika,aha,0
1718,Margit,`debug` should be `null` if you’re trying to use a maybe,0
1718,Margit,But I would use a decoder myself,0
1719,Mika,"Hi all. Is there a way to handle a missing flag in Elm? I tried `init : { queryString : String, debug : Maybe Bool } -&gt; ( Model, Cmd Msg )` where debug may or may not be present when elm is started as embedded",0
1720,Ervin,"Hello! I have to load a bunch of data from Json into my page, I am wondering what is the best way to do accomplish that without slowing down the loading of the page too much. Is it better to load all the data at the beginning, or to add a command to fetch the data when the user selects a certain type. For example, I have hospitals, nursing homes, hospices, etc.. data, is it better to fetch the data only when needed or to load everything in a model?",1
1720,Ervin,by a model I mean a record.,0
1720,Janine,"I would start by loading the data at the beginning, then see if it slows down the page",0
1720,Janine,Then see what parts slow it down.,0
1720,Janine,How much data are you talking about?,0
1720,Ervin,It takes about 5 to 7 seconds to load it.,0
1720,Liberty,"In a typical session, how much of that will your users have to load?",0
1720,Ervin,It all depends. Some my need all of that,0
1720,Ervin,sorry might need,0
1720,Margit,"Ervin: , what you are asking is a issue to do with the user experience and single page application design in general.",0
1720,Ervin,Right,0
1720,Margit,"First, identify the minimal amount of data required to display something useful to the user.",0
1720,Ervin,I am wondering what is the best practice,0
1720,Margit,"This might be nothing, this might just hospitals.",0
1720,Margit,The initial request should as small as possible. 5-7 seconds is a long time to wait for a page to load.,0
1720,Ima,"can you page through the data? I have a page that fetches 10 items, which is pretty quick, then fetches 100, then collects the rest in chunks of 1000. user sees something quickly, but all the data gets pulled eventually",0
1720,Ervin,"I was a bit unclear, the page doesn't take that long to load but the data takes that long to be fetched.",0
1720,Janine,"Margit: Like is saying, I’d load the minimal amount to show something on the page, then load the rest in the background.",0
1720,Ervin,"Adding a div on the page with ```div [] [ text (toString model.rolodexlists)]```, where rolodexList is the array of the data I am getting takes that long to be updated",0
1720,Ervin,I am wondering if it is better to get the data in batches later instead of in the initialModel through an initial Command,0
1720,Ervin,Janine: How do you load it in the background?,0
1720,Janine,"The same way to load it, create a cmd to load the data",0
1720,Janine,"don’t think of it as background, I guess, as much as thinking of it as loading it second",0
1720,Ervin,Where do you add the command for it to be in the background? (I am pretty new to Elm),0
1720,Janine,"Sort of a process like this 1) from `init` return the cmd (http request) to load the initial data 2) when the data arrives in your `update`, set it in your model, then return the cmd (next http request) from this `update`",0
1720,Janine,"My first pass would be to load it all initially, though, not sorry about it. Get the system working even with the 7 seconds. Then, once you have it working (slowly), then you can start peeling it away. I like the old saying Make it work, make it right, make it fast (in that order)",0
1720,Lady,"Ah right, we had discussed this. Writing down my ideas would be a useful exercise for me as well! Hopefully I have some time for higher-level design thoughts this Sunday.",0

1721,Lin,Hi all,0
1721,Lin,I have an app (dashboard with widgets) in which I'm constantly editing the model and then running PUT requests to save it,0
1721,Lin,I'm wondering what's the best way to be sure all the save requests are executed in the right order,1
1721,Lin,(with js I was storing a promise and chaining future requests to the globally saved promise inside a service),0
1721,Lin,is it possible to have something like saving a Task is the model and adding andThen at each update ?,0
1721,Lin,and of course I also want to use debouncing and I'm wondering how to best implement it (there seem to be several libraries on the subject but do you have any recommandation?),0
1721,Liberty,"you can store a `Task` in the model and andThen, but the task isn't actually evaluated when you do that",0
1721,Laraine,<http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/5.1.1/Task#sequence>,0
1721,Liberty,"also, elm is fundamentally asynchronous, so you'll have to deal with that",0
1721,Liberty,one solution could be to wait till the put request is finished before sending the next one,0
1721,Lin,yes that's what I want to do (what I'm doing actually in js today),0
1721,Lin,"when I need to save a new version, I get my promise and use a `promise = promise.then(() =&gt; { return model.put(); }`",0
1721,Lin,"using Task sequence seems right in elm but the first task needs to start as soon as possible, but if a second one arrives it must wait for the first one to complete",0
1721,Michelina,Are there any ways to create a nontrival Task (ie not one created through succeed or fail) in the core package?,0
1721,Liberty,Michelina: define non-trivial?,0
1721,Michelina,I did :X,0
1721,Liberty,"well, you can combine primitives with `map` and `andThen`",0
1721,Liberty,"so, yes",0
1721,Michelina,"`map` and `andThen` both require you already have a `Task`... so I guess to be more precise, one which does not contain any reference to `succeed` or `fail`. So `map (\x -&gt; x) (succeed True)` wouldn't really count, either.",0
1721,Liberty,"Lin: so I think you need to pick some nice data type to model what you want to do, for instance `type BackupRequest a = Sending { waiting : Maybe (Task Http.Error a) } | Done `",0
1721,Lin,"it seems I need to chain Cmd, not Tasks, which is not possible without a custom manual implementation... ?",0
1721,Liberty,"for custom stuff, tasks are the way to go",0
1721,Michelina,"Ah, it looks like the `Process` module exposes a few",0
1721,Liberty,"Michelina: well, `Time.now`",0
1721,Lin,"yes but once the task is started (attempt ?), you can't use it any more for `andThen`",0
1721,Liberty,TRUE,0
1721,Liberty,so you create a new empty task,0
1721,Lin,what for?,0
1721,Liberty,"actually, create a new task, that will be the next put",0
1721,Michelina,"Maybe I'm wrong, but `Task`s seem like they would be well-suited for working with random numbers.",0
1721,Liberty,"then as long as we're waiting for the server, swapping out that task with a newer version when the model is updated. once the request resolves, send the new task",0
1721,Lin,yes that's even an improved version,0
1721,Lin,"but the implementation is completely manual, no help form the core library",0
1721,Liberty,what would you like to see in core? it seems simple enough to implement and may give you material to publish a package,0
1721,Lin,not sure to be at the package level yet :wink:,0
1721,Lin,"but yes ok I'll try something like that with a pendingModelToBeSaved, swapping it with a new one when an update is made",0
1721,Janine,"For the data that changes, we usually have it in a type like (simplified) ``` type Savable a = Saved a | Saving a ``` Then, when a save is triggered, we don’t do it until it makes it back to `Saved` If you want to have a way to say “I want to save it when finished” then you can add another state to it, something like `SavePending`",0
1721,Janine,"So, the code only creates the PUT if it is in `Saved` state",0
1721,Ervin,"Janine: Thanks for the explanations, they are helpful!",0
1721,Janine,Ervin: Good luck.,0
1721,Ervin,Janine: Thanks!,0
1721,Lin,yes thx for the ideas,0
1721,Perla,Johnson: I’m wondering what the absolute timings in your benchmark are. I’ve found that for very short tasks things like requestAnimationFrame can add noise to Elm results,0
1721,Perla,another thing that chrome tools can help tell you…,0
1721,Neoma,Can I get an _object id_ for an Elm _object_? I want to have a JS cmd pass back the id into Elm so I can locate a tree-node that needs highlighting.,0
1721,Margit,"No, you have to create them.",0
1721,Margit,There are not objects in Elm in the same sense as elsewhere.,0
1721,Neoma,Is there a library for generating ids?,0
1721,Joni,"Perla: elm-benchmark uses interleaved samples of sufficient size, requestanimationframe isn't really that relevant here :slightly_smiling_face: (and the high-precision timing api)",0
1721,Perla,right on,0
1721,Joni,"<https://github.com/BrianHicks/elm-benchmark#how-are-my-benchmarks-measured> it's pretty cool, actually",0
1721,Sunny,"If you are rendering a bunch of objects in a list or a tree or something, then likely you have some identifier you can tag each node with that the js can pass back.",0
1721,Marilynn,lohabuyshan: <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/danyx23/elm-uuid/2.0.2/Uuid>,0
1721,Sunny,a name perhaps,0
1721,Neoma,"The tree nodes can be identical in all respects, except ancestry of course.",0
1721,Sunny,the they can be uniquely identified by a path then,0
1721,Neoma,"Would you go with that, as opposed to an id per-se?",0
1721,Perla,this does seem cool,0
1721,Sunny,what's the difference between and uniquely identifing ID and a uniquely identifying path?,0
1721,Sunny,aside from one being slightly more opaque,0
1721,Coreen,Johnson: responding here since the conversation has moved on a ways. The things that cause high stddev are usually other processes running or window painting happening. Browser benchmarks are tricky since it's basically a miniature operating system inside another OS.,0
1721,Coreen,"so: quit browser tabs, run in an incognito window if you have a lot of extensions, and quit any electron apps (especially Slack, which spikes CPU randomly.)",0
1721,Coreen,I'm happy to answer more questions in <#C3Y7SC0HF|elm-benchmark>; threads are a bit awkward :stuck_out_tongue:,0
1721,Neoma,"I may want to account for situation where in the interim the user can re-order the tree (for non-unique names of course), hence even though the path is fixed for now, path is not a universal solution.",0
1721,Sunny,I see,0
1721,Sunny,Random ids are going to require a task or some sort,0
1721,Laraine,not necesarely. you can use `step` function - is pseudo random - meaning if you call it with the same inputs you get the same outputs. See this mgold package. But you have a seed which you can store on your model - and you update the seed - and place it back on the model - every time you generate this random id. <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/mgold/elm-random-pcg/5.0.0/Random-Pcg#step>,0
1721,Sunny,I suppose a PRNG in your model would also work :stuck_out_tongue:,0
1722,Laurena,"Hi peeps! Just started out with Elm and I am trying to change the elm-styled module to collect css rules while rendering a view and emit them in a single virtualdom style tag at the end. I got really excited thinking I could use Mailboxes and foldp to achieve this nicely and then my text editor pointed out they no longer exist anymore. I can't create a closure with a mutable list to keep track of the rules, I can't traverse through the virtualdom nodes collecting data attributes - I'm about ready to give up! :slightly_smiling_face:",0
1722,Laurena,"Any suggestions, or is this a lost cause?",0
1722,Sunny,"Your're going to have to slow down there, what are you trying to do?",0
1722,Laurena,This library uses a nasty impure function to inject styles into a style tag:,0
1722,Laurena,<https://github.com/styled-components/elm-styled/blob/master/src/Styled.elm#L681>,0
1722,Laurena,"I am pretty sure the performance is not great, plus you could have hash collisions on rules",0
1722,Laurena,I imagined a world where you passed in an address as an argument to style and it would collect them all up in a mailbox while rendering a view,0
1722,Laurena,then at the end of the view render you could dump them into a virtualdom style tab,0
1722,Margit,Google Richard Feldman oslo elm day and watch that video,0
1722,Laurena,That's about elm-css though right?,0
1722,Margit,Yes,0
1722,Margit,Uses the same approach.,0
1722,Laurena,Well they use an npm module right?,0
1722,Laurena,Or inline styles,0
1722,Margit,Inline styles via a style tag,0
1722,Margit,wait,0
1722,Margit,hang on,0
1722,Margit,"No, it does things differently",0
1722,Laurena,I thought they applied the styles to the actual dom nodes,0
1722,Margit,I don’t know why on earth they’re using a native function to inject css to the style tag.,0
1722,Margit,It’s not needed.,0
1722,Margit,Laurena: Nope. We put styles into an explicit style tag.,0
1722,Margit,You _can_ use it for compiled CSS,0
1722,Margit,"but if you watch the talk by Richard, he talks about the different approaches a bit in there.",0
1722,Margit,"FWIW we tested performance with real, production code",0
1722,Laurena,"I'll take a look, but does that mean there is no pithy ""replace mailbox/foldp with X"" statement :slightly_smiling_face:",0
1722,Margit,And the approach that the styled-css thing is taking is actually slower than using a reguarl &lt;style&gt; in the body.,0
1722,Laurena,That's what I'm trying to fix :slightly_smiling_face:,0
1722,Margit,what are you trying to fix?,0
1722,Margit,It’s easy to fix that - just use a style tag in the body.,0
1722,Margit,"Collisions aren’t an issue, if you use namespacing (which is general best practice for large production sites)",0
1722,Laurena,"Ok, hang on - let me try and explain this again one more time :slightly_smiling_face:",0
1722,Laurena,"Ignoring the CSS part, which I think is a bit of a red herring",0
1722,Laurena,I have a view,0
1722,Laurena,"As it builds up the virtual dom, I would like to accumulate some state",0
1722,Laurena,that I can then append in a new node at the end,0
1722,Margit,What state?,0
1722,Laurena,"In this case, CSS rules :slightly_smiling_face:",0
1722,Margit,What do you mean by “builds up the virtual dom”?,0
1722,Laurena,"Ok, so:",0
1722,Laurena,This guy:,0
1722,Laurena,"```view model = div [] [ h1 [] [ text ""Hi"" ] , console [ Html.Attributes.id consoleId ] [ text model.lines ] , button [ onClick (Send ""Hello"") ] [ text ""Append"" ] ] ```",0
1722,Laurena,The console function is actually a styled div,0
1722,Laurena,"Inside that function, it's generating some namespaced css rules",0
1722,Laurena,"but I don't want to create a &lt;style&gt; tag for every styled component - I could, but it would be nasty",0
1722,Margit,"So, two questions: - Why do you think it would be nasty? - What is the type of the console function?",0
1722,Laurena,Doesn't IE have a hard limit on the number of style tags you can have in a document for starters?,0
1722,Laurena,Console looks like this:,0
1722,Laurena,"```console = styled Html.pre [ padding (em 4) , backgroundColor (hex ""000"") , color (hex ""fff"") , height (px 300) , overflowY scroll ] ```",0
1722,Laraine,is not clear why this can't be done using just function application. console is a specialized version of some div - with styles applied. is it not?,0
1722,Margit,"Laurena: , what is the _type_ of that function?",0
1722,Laurena,It returns a `-&gt; Html.Html msg` right?,0
1722,Laurena,I literally started programming Elm today :slightly_smiling_face:,0
1722,Margit,"No, I don’t think it does.",0
1722,Laurena,In another language I might do this:,0
1722,Laurena,"``` view model = stylesheet (\css -&gt; div [] [ h1 [] [ text ""Hi"" ] , css `console [ Html.Attributes.id consoleId ] [ text model.lines ] , button [ onClick (Send ""Hello"") ] [ text ""Append"" ] ] ) ```",0
1722,Margit,Depends on the type of that `styled` function.,0
1722,Laurena,and have `css` evaluate a literal and then save the rules into a list,0
1722,Laurena,"and then at the end of the stylesheet function, dump out a &lt;style&gt; tag",0
1722,Margit,That is not how Elm works nor will it ever be,0
1722,Laurena,"No, exactly!",0
1722,Margit,"Great, so we’re on the same page.",0
1722,Laurena,"```view model = stylesheet (\mailbox -&gt; div [] [ h1 [] [ text ""Hi"" ] , console mailbox [ Html.Attributes.id consoleId ] [ text model.lines ] , button [ onClick (Send ""Hello"") ] [ text ""Append"" ] ] ) ```",0
1722,Laurena,"So then I thought this, with a foldp at the end",0
1722,Laurena,imagine mailbox is accumulating rules as the view runs,0
1722,Margit,:scream:,0
1722,Laurena,haha :slightly_smiling_face:,0
1722,Laurena,I want the output to be:,0
1722,Margit,That would not have been a good idea even in 0.15.,0
1722,Margit,"Okay, hold up a sec",0
1722,Laurena,"``````div [] [ h1 [] [ text ""Hi"" ] , div [ Html.Attributes.id consoleId ] [ text model.lines ] , button [ onClick (Send ""Hello"") ] [ text ""Append"" ] ] style ...rules from every styled element```",0
1722,Margit,"That library has sadly led you down a bad path - in Elm, we _like_ things to be pure",0
1722,Laurena,"Yup, I like that also",0
1722,Margit,"So, don’t think about side effects or magic or mutation",0
1722,Margit,Think about it in terms of pureness,0
1722,Laurena,I just don't know how I do it without some kind of Monad type thing and forcing the user to totally rewrite the structure to be functors or something,0
1722,Margit,"If you want to return two things from a pure function, how would you do that?",0
1722,Laurena,"In this case, I really do just want to accumulate elements in a list. I know that is naughty, but I don't want to have to insert a bunch of boilerplate in front of every function call",0
1722,Laurena,:slightly_smiling_face:,0
1722,Margit,"Ignore the boilerplate, ignore the the elements, ignore everything else",0
1722,Margit,"If you wanted to return two things from a function, how would you do that?",0
1722,Laurena,"I have rewritten styled, this third party library to return a record with a node and a list of Strings",0
1722,Laurena,in one of my many iterations on this problem,0
1722,Laurena,Then I still struggle to collect those all together without having to modify the way a view normally looks,0
1722,Laurena,"I've also tried adding the css as `data-css` attribute. That's nice, except VirtualDom wont let you traverse and transform the output :slightly_smiling_face:",0
1722,Margit,"So then your type looks like this, right? `styled : List (Html msg) -&gt; List (Attribute Msg) -&gt; (Html.Html msg, Css)`",0
1722,Laurena,The stock library looks like this:,0
1722,Laurena,```styled : (List (Property msg) -&gt; List (Node msg) -&gt; Node msg) -&gt; List Rule -&gt; List (Property msg) -&gt; List (Node msg) -&gt; address -&gt; Node msg```,0
1722,Margit,You’re going to have a bad time if you keep trying to think of things in terms of mutating away and doing everything to avoid boilerplate,0
1722,Margit,So that code isn’t even 0.17,0
1722,Laurena,"OH, sorry",0
1722,Laurena,I added the signal earlier,0
1722,Laurena,haha,0
1722,Laurena,that's what led me here,0
1722,Laurena,Ignore that part :slightly_smiling_face:,0
1722,Laurena,NOT HELPING :slightly_smiling_face:,0
1722,Laurena,"haha, sorry",0
1722,Laurena,I don't think transforming a tree is particularly naughty - it's still pure,0
1722,Margit,That type signature does not make sense to me still. By property do you mean `Attribute msg`?,0
1722,Margit,Or is it some custom type the library uses?,0
1722,Laurena,<https://github.com/styled-components/elm-styled/blob/master/src/Styled.elm#L658>,0
1722,Laurena,Is that helpful?,0
1722,Laurena,Should take you straight to the line,0
1722,Margit,"I see, so it’s a custom type they’ve invented.",0
1722,Margit,Let’s take a step back: Why are you trying to use this library?,0
1722,Laurena,"`import VirtualDom exposing (Node, Property)`",0
1722,Laurena,It's just a `VirtualDom.Property`,0
1722,Margit,Yes,0
1722,Laurena,"I'm using the library because it handles hashing the contents of a stylesheet to create a namespace, which elm-css does not (yet)",0
1722,Laurena,"and because I think it could be wicked cool if I can get it to collect all the rules, emit one style at the end and leverage the virtualdom to no-op if no styles have changed",0
1722,Laurena,"No weird external build process, just pure elm",0
1722,Margit,The virtualdom will already do that for you.,0
1722,Laurena,"Yes, exactly :slightly_smiling_face:",0
1722,Margit,This is premature optimization for sure.,0
1722,Laurena,I'm not saying I will do that - I'm saying it does that :slightly_smiling_face:,0
1722,Margit,"There is no need to collect all the rules, is what I am saying.",0
1722,Laurena,"If I don't collect the rules, I have to emit one style per element:",0
1722,Margit,I’ve benchmarked it :wink:,0
1722,Laurena,"```nodeWithClassName = node (classNameProperty :: properties) ((VirtualDom.node ""style"" [] [Html.text (String.join ""\n"" css)]) :: children)```",0
1722,Margit,It does not need to be one per element.,0
1722,Laurena,That's the level this library emits rules at,0
1722,Laurena,"when it renders a component, it emits the rules",0
1722,Laurena,Hence trying to gather them up :_),0
1722,Margit,What I am saying is that this library does not follow good Elm best practices,0
1722,Laurena,The only thing it seems to do wrong is use a nasty native function,0
1722,Margit,"Any kind of trying to manpiluate and collect styles will be counter productive, since that will happen _on every re-render_",0
1722,Laurena,Yup,0
1722,Margit,"So, why are you trying to collect the styles?",0
1722,Margit,Here’s another tact,0
1722,Laurena,"Because as I understand it, having lots of &lt;style&gt; tags is bad, but you cant do @keyframe animations using javascript properties",0
1722,Laurena,this namespaces those too,0
1722,Margit,"Having benchmarked it, in Elm, lots of style tags does not have negative performance impacts.",0
1722,Laurena,ok,0
1722,Margit,New statement: let’s forget all about that library,0
1722,Margit,Have a look at this example: <https://github.com/mdgriffith/style-elements/blob/3.1.0/examples/Chat.elm>,0
1722,Margit,And read this README: <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/mdgriffith/style-elements/latest>,0
1722,Margit,Does that seem more like something you would like?,0
1722,Laurena,"I found the documentation on that library to be a bit obtuse to be honest :slightly_smiling_face: But yeah, it looked promising",0
1722,Laurena,It feels like a lot of the documentation floating about is out of date or ... terse :slightly_smiling_face:,0
1722,Margit,"Well, here’s a little secret",0
1722,Laurena,I'm not complaining! haha,0
1722,Laurena,I'm just trying to explain why I went to all this batshit trouble instead of just using that library,0
1722,Margit,"Earline: seems to sit on slack and watch <#C4F9NBLR1|style-elements> like a hawk, and answers everyone’s questions about it there",0
1722,Margit,Including “How do I get start with style-elements?”,0
1722,Laurena,"Ok, that's a good suggestion thanks. :slightly_smiling_face:",0
1722,Margit,"My recommendation would be this: play around with style-elements for a bit. Try elm-css out too, to see how it feels. Once you have a practical understanding of how those libraries work, come back here and let’s chat about it",0
1722,Margit,I recommend watching this video: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5faeSW71ko> and the video about style-elements when that gets released.,0
1722,Sunny,Earline: I get the feeling that is watching this right now,0
1722,Laurena,My neck is tingling,0
1722,Laurena,OH GOD HE IS BEHIND ME,0
1722,Laurena,"Oh, thank christ - it's just my pet house ghost",0
1722,Laurena,NOT NOW DEAD GHOST,0
1722,Laurena,BAD GHOST,0
1722,Margit,Hmmm :thinking_face:,0
1722,Laurena,Does the elm virtual dom implementation have any performance shortcuts deep down like react-id / key,0
1722,Margit,"Generally, if you’re asking questions like that before writing any Elm, then you’re asking them at the wrong time entirely",0
1722,Margit,But yes: `Html.Lazy` and `Html.Keyed`,0
1722,Laurena,"Ok, great",0
1722,Laurena,I'm just looking for common ground :slightly_smiling_face:,0
1722,Laurena,"Ah, great",0
1722,Laurena,I've written a looooot in react :slightly_smiling_face:,0
1722,Genaro,"&gt; I've written a looooot in react in my experience, this is unfortunately a disadvantage in coming to Elm",0
1722,Genaro,a tiny bit of React experience can be a springboard in that you already are familiar with the Virtual DOM concept,0
1722,Genaro,but that's all they have in common,0
1722,Genaro,"and everything after that is more and more knowledge that no longer applies, and is challenging to unlearn :disappointed:",0
1722,Genaro,"so as far as looking for common ground goes - I'd say ""the idea of a Virtual DOM data structure that describes how you want the page to look"" and then absolutely nothing else",0
1722,Genaro,and trying as hard as possible to mentally reset :slightly_smiling_face:,0
1722,Laurena,"I don't know, redux isn't that dissimilar to the Elm Architecture right?",0
1722,Margit,Redux was based on the Elm architecture.,0
1722,Genaro,&gt; I don't know this is a good mindset to have &gt; redux isn't that dissimilar to the Elm Architecture right? I think this mindset is going to make life harder :wink:,0
1722,Margit,"However, it heavily relies on mutation and the lack of type safety to achieve some things",0
1722,Margit,"Such as how reducers get merged, etc.",0
1722,Margit,"And every time you have some localized state, then you are fighting against the principles that Elm tries to stick to.",0
1722,Margit,"In Elm, it’s best to stick to functions whereever possible, and just take a model, an update loop, and a view, and work with that.",0
1722,Margit,"Just like Elm is not ML or Haskell, Redux is not Elm",0
1722,Laurena,"Genaro: Oh, hi you are the guy from the video",0
1722,Laurena,:slightly_smiling_face:,0

1727,Sybil,`elm-format` adds the standard space of 2 lines between a comment and a function. Is that really correct formatting?,0
1727,Sybil,Looks terribly awkward to have such distance between a comment related to a function and the function in question,0
1727,Margit,Use a `{-|` comment,0
1727,Margit,it’s only single line comments that that happens to,0
1727,Sybil,Alright. But is it a bug or is it deliberate?,0
1727,Sybil,"No matter if it's a single or multi-line comment, having such a space between a comment and the thing the comment is related to feels wrong.",0
1727,Maxima,"Sybil: It's deliberate. The reason is that comments between functions which are not ""function comments "" (`{-|`) are used as dividers.",0
1727,Maxima,So... ``` {- TYPES -} type Person = Person String Int {- FUNCTIONS -} {-| This function extracts the name from a person -} name : Person -&gt; String name (Person name _) = name ```,0
1727,Maxima,It only happens at top level though. Single or multi-line comments within function bodies or type definitions do not get that treatment.,0

1729,Mina,What are the common approaches to profiling Elm apps?,1
1730,Laraine,"how can i read DOM information about an element - immediately after it has been created - but with no interaction form the user? I'm showing text inside some boxes - and this boxes are layd out in 2d plane - and i need to detect if they collide or not - - for that i need their dimension - width height- and absolute positioning. I use <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/MichaelCombs28/elm-dom/1.0.0/DOM#boundingClientRect> But how can i get this info without no user interaction? How do i know how to lay out this boxes - up front? Calculating their future dimensions in pure elm is not an option. I need to render them first, then get their dimensions and positions. all this without the user doing anything... hmm any ideas? :thinking_face:",0
1730,Laraine,"i need to go, but please if you have any ideas on how this can be done - let me know :smile:",0
1730,Kaylee,Laraine: there is no way to do this without ports,0
1730,Soraya,you can't use CSS for this somehow?,0
1730,Kaylee,"Laraine: if you explain layout, maybe we can come up with a different solution",0
1730,Laraine,hey i'm back,0
1730,Laraine,"yes, i'll show you a picture.",0
1730,Laraine,Kaylee: loading..,0
1730,Laraine,for generating what i have here - i only rely on the relative/absolute positioning - and i only need to know the height of the orange box - and the width of the blue box - and using this alternation of relative/absolute positioning i generate this. The orange boxes contain blue boxes and the blue boxes contain orange boxes. And what i'm trying to solve is: 1. when adding a new box - i need to make sure it doesn't collide with an already expanded column or row. 2. when expanding a row - i need to make sure it doesn't collide with an already expanded row or column. And this can be at any level of nesting.. So that's why i need all this dom info - because this boxes will contain UI stuff inside - like text - that can;t be calculated up front - only after i render them - i get their widths and heights- and the absolute positioning related to the the viewport / document.,0
1730,Laraine,"so just to explain some more. ``` type BlueBox = { id: Int, width: Int, orangeBoxes : List Int } type OrangeBox = { id: Int, height: Int, blueBoxes: List Int } ``` So i only keep a reference &gt; i don't store them literally inside one another. It's a flat data structure. In a dict. Now i want this to be transformed into: ``` type BlueBox = { id: Int, width: Int, orangeBoxes : List Int, geometryStuff: Dom.BoundingClientStuff } type OrangeBox = { id: Int, height: Int, blueBoxes: List Int, geometryStuff: Dom.BoundingClientStuff } ``` And load this geometry in - somehow - after everything is rendered using this absolute/relative stuff i have.",0
1730,Soraya,it seems like you could trigger the port cmd to update the dimensions on those 2 actions you mention (adding a new box and expanding a row).,0
1730,Soraya,"If the dimensions of the new box are fixed, and expanding a row is a pixel at a time etc., you could check for collisions ahead of time - no?",0
1730,Laraine,"ok. i need to go for a few minutes, but i'm back real soon - that souds interesting - not sure if i got it yet.",0
1730,Soraya,interesting looking project...,0
1730,Maxima,Reducing code size even without minifying.,0
1730,Kaylee,is it an option to fix the dimensions and then calculate the positioning?,0
1730,Kaylee,you seem to keep the size somewhere because you allow resizing,0
1730,Kaylee,what if everything was positioned absolutely?,0
1730,Laraine,"ok, i think i partially underestand what you say - when having any action for creatiing stuff - you say to command a port to get the rendered stuff back. So it goes like this: -&gt;` i receive the message createBlueBox` -&gt; `i add it to the model in a ""not ready yet state"" AND then send the port command.` -&gt;` then in the view this new box get's rendered` - and `js listens for when this is rendered`. When this render happens - the `js sends me back the geometry info` -&gt; `and i move the model in ""ready/complete state""` So the hole point is to have this intermediary step - where i render - and wait for js to give me back what i need. What was confusing at first - is that the first time the app loads - i have many boxes not just one. But i will solve that by storing all this geometry information in firebase or something - and when it comes all at once - i already have all this info from before. So the problem then becomes - making sure that each box that i add - will get the the geometry information individually. And this is not that bad. I only need 2 ports i think. Hmm we will see - thanks so much for now :smiley: . And no, - positioning everything absolutely i try to avoid that - because will require even more manual computation. I want to let the browser do as much as i can. But maybe i will be forced to do that. I'm in experimenting phase now - not sure about anything yet.",0
1730,Laraine,Soraya: i'll keep you in the loop :smile:,0

1730,Laraine,very true :smile: you too.,0
1731,Claud,Hello Everyone :smile:,0
1731,Claud,So I have a quick question for you folks. I am creating a game with elm and I am trying to figure out something. So i am creating an Hacking simulation game where my main app is an OS. I want to put buttons in where it allows me to open a small window within the page. I am not sure where to start with that.,0
1731,Laraine,how can i receive a `Result Error Success` type - inside my inbound port - instead of a normal type `string / list` . I mean i want js to tell me if i got a succes or error. And not use 2 different ports for that.,0
1731,Laraine,Claud: so this `small window within the page` - is just a normal div - that is styled to look like a window?,0
1731,Soraya,"what I was thinking was you might not need a ""not ready"" state for individual boxes, if the boxes are initialized to a fixed size, and you have the geometry of the rest of the boxes.",0
1731,Claud,So essential it will be like this.....You are in windows and you click on the chrome icon and chrome browser pops up. I will be able to do things within that window.,0
1731,Claud,I haven't officially started coding it yet. I am kind of making small plans and seeing if my ideas can actually work.,0
1731,Soraya,"`I receive the message CreateBlueBox` -&gt; `I check if it would collide with any existing box based on its default geometry` -&gt; `If so, handle the error case; if not, render the new box and send out a port request to re-fetch geometry`",0
1731,Soraya,"you'd just need a global ""not ready"" state for when you fetch the geometry of the first box",0
1731,Laraine,hmm - i made a mistake when i mention that i know the length of the orange boxes. I know it here - in this demo - i generated randomly as you can see - but in reality will be calculated based on the text it contains. So there is no inititial/default geometry. A `Global not ready state` sounds like an interesting idea. :smiley:,0
1731,Soraya,Laraine: Elm can automatically handle Maybe's coming from javascript (`null` turns into `Nothing`),0
1731,Soraya,<https://guide.elm-lang.org/interop/javascript.html>,0
1731,Soraya,if that helps,0
1731,Laraine,"Result allows for a string to be passed in, in the case of Error.. Maybe is just Nothing -&gt; that's why i'm interested in Result type..",0
1731,Soraya,ah ok,0
1731,Janine,Laraine: you could pass in an `Decode.Value` and then decode it into a `Result`,0
1731,Soraya,"right, sometimes you don't care about the error message so Maybe would work.. if you need a Result yes exactly what coreyhaines said",0
1732,Lorinda,"Claud: , I recently made this in Elm : <http://www.ct-os.us|www.ct-os.us>",0
1732,Lorinda,Sounds similar to what you are going for. I would be happy to share the code or tell you about it.,0

1734,Liberty,"hmm, right",0
1734,Liberty,"so, <https://github.com/elm-lang/html/blob/2.0.0/src/Html/Attributes.elm#L177> has a `boolProperty` function",0
1734,Liberty,I think that is what you want to replicate that using <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/virtual-dom/2.0.4/VirtualDom#property>,0
1734,Santa,Mhm... it's not exposed and looks like an internal helper. How would I use it?,0
1734,Liberty,replicate it,0
1734,Santa,"But I think it will still output quoted value, wouldn't it?",0
1734,Liberty,I think it wouldn't,0
1734,Santa,"Ok, let me try.",0
1734,Liberty,"wait, this is for something else, like things that are present or not",0
1734,Liberty,"like `hidden` or `selected`, that's not what you want right?",0
1734,Santa,Actually this would work too.,0
1734,Santa,"Yeah, this does the job: ``` opened : Bool -&gt; Html.Attribute msg opened value = property ""opened"" (Json.Encode.bool value) ```",0
1734,Santa,Liberty: Thanks,0
1734,Liberty,cool,0
1734,Santa,Now I just need to figure out how to decode custom event `opened-changed` from `app-drawer`. Is there a way to print raw event data to console? I guess `Debug.log` but how?,0
1734,Liberty,"yes, you'll need to use <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/html/2.0.0/Html-Events#on>",0
1734,Liberty,"then use the <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/5.1.1/Json-Decode#value> like `Decode.map (Debug.log ""event data"") Decode.value`",0
1734,Liberty,and that will print the complete object,0
1734,Santa,Lost connectivity for a while.,0
1734,Santa,"I assume I have to pass the `Decode.Value` to my `Msg`, and then `Debug.log` in the `update`. Right?",0
1734,Santa,Or is there a better way?,0
1734,Liberty,do you have some NoOp in your `Msg`?,0
1734,Santa,"Oh, not yet. Good idea!",0
1734,Santa,Then where should I put the call to `Debug.log`?,0
1734,Santa,"In the `view`? I feel these are silly questions, but I'm still wrapping my head around Elm (and FP).",0
1734,Liberty,before turning to NoOp,0
1734,Liberty,"so `Decode.map ((\_ -&gt; NoOp) &lt;&lt; Debug.log ""event data"") Decode.value`",0
1734,Santa,"Like that: `on ""opened-changed"" (Decode.map ((\_ -&gt; NoOp) &lt;&lt; Debug.log ""event data"") Decode.value)`?",0
1734,Liberty,yup,0
1734,Santa,:shit: I must have broke something else. I'm getting `Maximum call stack size exceeded`. Let me figure this out first and I'll get back with the results.,0
1734,Santa,Thanks for your help so far.,0
1734,Michelina,"Elm doesn't try to emulate tail recursion, does it?",0
1734,Michelina,I came across that the other day,0
1734,Liberty,it does,0
1734,Michelina,maybe my issue was something else then.,0
1734,Kaylee,tactics40: <https://evancz.gitbooks.io/functional-programming-in-elm/recursion/tail-call-elimination.html>,0
1734,Michelina,thanks.,0
1734,Soraya,"lazurski I've gotten that too, I think because the event object contains circular references... there may be a way with `Decode.lazy`",0
1734,Liberty,isn't there just some documentation for the event you want to decode?,0
1734,Soraya,:point_up:,0
1734,Santa,"Liberty: Soraya: that's likely. doesn't look that way, unless you call this a documentation: <https://www.webcomponents.org/element/PolymerElements/app-layout/app-drawer#event-opened-changed>",0
1734,Santa,I've briefly googled it and figured I can just try to see for myself.,0
1734,Santa,I guess I just `console.log` it in javascript land.,0
1734,Liberty,"so, what do you actually want to do with that event?",0
1734,Santa,I need to know what the change was (opened or closed) to update my model accordingly.,0
1734,Santa,Maybe I can just assume that it's in sync and do `{ model | drawerOpened = not model.drawerOpened }` but it doesn't seem safe.,0
1734,Santa,I'd prefer to extract it from the event.,0
1734,Liberty,yea that makes sense,0
1734,Liberty,guess a quick trip to the js console is the quickest option,0
1734,Santa,"Soraya: Liberty: Yeah, got it. Thanks again and . Now off to learn about `Json.Decode` :smile:",0
1734,Liberty,the source code for events might be helpful <https://github.com/elm-lang/html/blob/2.0.0/src/Html/Events.elm>,0
1734,Santa,"Yeah, good tip.",0
1734,Santa,If I know the exact path do I still need to worry about circular references in the object I am decoding ?,0
1734,Liberty,I don't think so,0
1734,Liberty,but only one way to find out :slightly_smiling_face:,0
1734,Santa,:construction_worker:,0
1734,Santa,Liberty: My drawer works like a charm :thumbsup: You were right about Events module source code .,0
1735,Cristy,"Hi yall, any easy way to *encode* a data structure given its *decoder*?",1
1735,Soraya,haven't used it at all but this came around a while back. <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/prozacchiwawa/elm-json-codec/latest>,0
1735,Cristy,Soraya: Hmmm looks interesting. thanks,0
1735,Margit,json-to-elm can do that for you,0
1735,Cristy,wow that's very handy,0
1735,Cristy,"But I do feel that having to create separate encoders and decoders could be better abstracted, such as that elm-json-codec project above",0
1735,Cristy,"How to use the browser's local storage from elm? I can't find any packages on elm-package for that. I did find this repo, but it doesn't seem to be elm-package installable: <https://github.com/gdotdesign/elm-storage>",0

1735,Soraya,rfeldman's SPA example I found extremely useful to look at. <https://github.com/rtfeldman/elm-spa-example/blob/master/src/Main.elm> <https://github.com/rtfeldman/elm-spa-example/blob/master/src/Ports.elm> <https://github.com/rtfeldman/elm-spa-example/blob/master/index.html>,0

1736,Santa,Hello! I want to fork and hack on an Elm library simultaneously with building my application and eventually PR the upstream repo. How would I set this up locally? In NPM land I would use `npm link`. Are there any established practices for Elm?,1
1736,Joni,you could use `elm_self_publish.py` found here: <https://github.com/NoRedInk/elm-ops-tooling>,0
1736,Joni,which allows you to locally install a package into another package,0
1736,Santa,Joni: Thanks . Let me take a look.,0
1736,Santa,"Related question: is there a way to install forked Elm pacakge from git repo, like NPM can do?",0
1736,Santa,I see this <https://github.com/gdotdesign/elm-github-install>,0
1736,Santa,Can I do it with standard Elm tools?,0
1736,Joni,"Nope, standard elm package can't do that - since then all limitations like ""no packages with native"" are essentially out of the window...",0
1736,Santa,Hmm. Ok. I'll try simply link forked library's `src/` into my app's `src/` and see how it flies. I'm using `elm-live` for my app development and would like to preserve the rebuild on save for the library as well.,0
1736,Joni,"Then you could add a `vendor` library, clone the project in there, and add `vendor/somelib/src` to the `source-directories` of your `elm-package.json`",0
1736,Joni,"though, take care, because that allows using the non-exposed modules from that library, too :slightly_smiling_face:",0
1737,Laraine,rcook: check this out - very nice intro : <https://elmseeds.thaterikperson.com/elm-benchmark>,0
1737,Laraine,hmm it is possible to use decoder pipeline - with NO TYPE ALIAS for a record? do I have to build all this type aliases if i have objects inside objects??,0
1737,Joni,"Laraine: `decode (\name age occupation -&gt; { name = name, age = age, occupation = occupation })`",0
1737,Joni,the type alias just gives you this constructor for free,0
1737,Laraine,ah! Yes lambda :purple_heart:,0
1737,Laraine,if i have a record with a filed that contains a union type - what can i do to it to send it to js / what is the best way to store union types in json ?! Say i need them for firebase or something. `{ field = IsRootNode 1 } ` =&gt; Where `IsRootNode` is the union type constructor.,0
1737,Liberty,"one option is to do it the same way elm objects are represented in js: construct an json object that looks like `{ constructor : ""IsRootNode"", value : 1 } `",0
1737,Laraine,"aha, that makes sense. And for decoding them back? ``` case constructor of ""IsRootNode"" -&gt; IsRootNode -- But the constructor will generate different function types depending on how many arguments it has, ``` Will this play nice with the generic value? The arguments have different types - and there can be any number of arguments.",0
1737,Laraine,"`{ field : IsRootNode 1 ""someString"" True }`",0
1737,Laraine,using a ~~list of values can work for encoding~~ - Edit: Only if they are the same type of value i guess.. But is not so clear to me how i use this list of values in the decoding step.,0
1737,Liberty,"you'll need to use `andThen` a lot, but it's possible",0
1737,Laraine,"hmm ok, `possible` -&gt; that's the important part. :smile: thanks. Guess this is not very recommended.?! - given that is harder to decode.",0
1737,Liberty,it's the only way really,0
1737,Laraine,"no, i mean is not recommended to store stuff inside union constructors?",0
1737,Laraine,seems to be better to keep them in normal records fields if possible.,0
1737,Joni,I don't see the difference?,0
1737,Joni,"In a record, the fields are labeled, in a union tag, they're positional. When decoding, they're positional anyway... Anyway, you could do something like this: <https://ellie-app.com/3zkrBCHtz39a1/0>",0
1738,Laraine,"Joni: regarding previous question, how can i make this `Decode.andThen` fit with the `Decode.Pipeline`? I have the `geometry` field after the filed with the `union decoder` - and it changes things a bit form what you provided there in ellie. ``` (Pipeline.decode (\elementIdAndType geometry -&gt; { elementIdAndType = elementIdAndType, geometry = geometry }) |&gt; Pipeline.required ""elementIdAndType"" Decode.string |&gt; Decode.andThen decodeElement - here decodeElement is the union decoder. |&gt; Pipeline.required ""geometry"" Decode.string --for now. ) ``` :thinking_face:",0
1738,Joni,"add some parens, `|&gt; Pipeline.required ""elementIdAndType"" (Decode.string |&gt; Decode.andThen decodeElement)`",0
1738,Laraine,he he works :smile:,0
1739,Christia,"hi all, has anyone experience with elm-plot?",0
1739,Christia,I am just wondering if histogram plots are possible with horizontal bars. Could not find hints in the docs.,0
1739,Liberty,Christia: there is an <#C2W8GFQF9|elm-plot> channel,0
1739,Christia,thanks,0
1739,Laraine,Christia: i'm sure this is a good tutorial <https://elmseeds.thaterikperson.com/elm-plot>,0
1740,Gertie,Does anyone know a good elm-expressjs boilerplate? I was trying to do a small SPA with a small GraphQL server but I was wondering how to best organize my repo,1
1741,Laraine,what is necessary to do for elm to interact with the file system? I just finished configuring `web-pack` for an older project - and i lost like 2-3 hours - jumping form one error to another. And i'm not the only one - i see all over i look in Github - ton of people commenting about this errors and showing different solutions.. it's a phenomena.. Complex tools like `web-pack` will greatly benefit for being implemented in a language like elm. I know elm can't do that right now - but just want to get a glimpse of what are the major challendges that need to be overcomed for doing stuff like this.,0
1742,Dewey,"hello, can I turn a custom type into a `comparable` type?",0
1742,Leonard,Dewey: No.,0
1742,Dewey,thanks!,0
1742,Dewey,regarding list,0
1742,Dewey,I'm building a `List a`,0
1742,Dewey,and I need to upsert items from that list,0
1742,Dewey,but in elm you don't update items right?,0
1742,Dewey,should I build a new list?,0
1742,Dewey,every time/,0
1742,Laraine,"Dewey: everything in elm is imutable - and you can't change that - check this article out : <https://www.sitepoint.com/immutability-javascript/> There is no updating, anywhere in the real sense of the word.",0
1742,Johnson,Dewey: There are helpers for updating items in elm-community/list-extra,0
1742,Johnson,Use them sparingly though because they actually need to create a new copy of your data,0
1742,Johnson,"Regarding `comparable`, for most functions that accept a `comparable` there is a variant that accepts a `(a -&gt; comparable)` function that allows you to “treat the elements as comparable” for the purposes of that function.",0
1742,Johnson,"In practice, the lack of the ability to make custom types `comparable` is rarely a problem",0
1742,Janine,"As with everything, though, measure to make sure that the data structures are the problem. For example, in our system, we use lists as the underlying collection type for all our stuff, and we do a good amount of updating. We haven’t found the performance to be an issue. The list implementation is done well, so, unless you are holding A LOT of items in it, you probably won’t see a problem.",0
1742,Janine,"Also, it doesn’t actually have to update your data. If it is implemented as a traditional linked list, then it doesn’t even have to update the whole list, only those nodes that are before the updated one, keeping the ones after it the same exact ones.",0
1742,Janine,"For us, the uniformity and ease of working with lists makes it really nice, so we don’t have to think “oh, this is a `Dict`” or “oh, we used an `Array` here”. Of course, as with everything, YMMV",0
1742,Janine,"`List.Extra` has a nice `updateIf` function, that we use. It is also constructable from `List.map` if you don’t want to import `List.Extra`, although I’d recommend it. :slightly_smiling_face:",0
1742,Dewey,Johnson: thanks,0
1742,Dewey,"now, let's say I have a chat app, which displays messages, like slack,",0
1742,Dewey,"every time a new message comes in, it's appended into the list of messages,",0
1742,Dewey,assuming the chat box have millions of messages,0
1742,Dewey,how efficient is to copy data each time?,0
1742,Johnson,Appending to the front should be constant time.,0
1742,Johnson,"Or I guess I should just say ""prepending""",0
1742,Dewey,but it creates a copy anyway,0
1742,Johnson,Dewey: it is a pretty standard linked list implementation.,0
1742,Johnson,Copying without modification is pretty fast iirc,0
1742,Liberty,"pretty sure the when you prepend, the tail is actually shared. At least in haskell, there are some further tricks to minimize actual copying",0
1742,Dewey,"ok, that makes sense",0
1742,Joni,"Yeah, prepending is constant time",0
1742,Leonard,"Still, don't worry too much about lists unless you are experiencing actual problems. Refactoring to another data structure might take some time, but the compiler provides so much support that it is surprisingly safe.",0
1742,Liberty,and updating the dom often takes orders of magnitude more time than data processing if you're not doing anything crazy,0
1742,Janine,"And, don’t mix up “making a copy of the list” with “making a copy of your data.”",0
1742,Janine,"So, if you replace a specific item in the list, nothing is actually copied.",0
1742,Janine,The beauty of persistent data structures,0
1742,Soraya,"Upsert is kind of interesting to consider. Obviously Set or Dict would be preferable, but we'd lose the list order. Doing it with a list (List.Extra functions or a custom fold) is less than ideal.",0
1742,Soraya,"If you have a limited set of functions to do on your list, let's say just upsert and remove, you could write your own data structure that combines the best of both worlds. I had a play around with doing this: <https://runelm.io/c/x5m>",0
1743,Sybil,How do people deal with authorization? I'm having so much trouble creating Route types where I can combine route with route privacy,0
1743,Deandre,etected errors in 1 module. -- NAMING ERROR ---------------------------------------------------------------- Cannot find type `Model` 25| update : Action -&gt; Model -&gt; Model ^^^^^ -- NAMING ERROR ---------------------------------------------------------------- Cannot find type `Model` 25| update : Action -&gt; Model -&gt; Model,0
1743,Deandre,"please, what am i doing wrong...",0
1743,Liberty,"well, you don't define a `Model`",0
1743,Liberty,"at least, not as a type alias",0
1743,Liberty,so you should add ``` type alias Model = { cat : Int } -- model model : Model model = { cat = 1 } ```,0
1743,Deandre,"thanks, it works.",0
1743,Leonardo,what do you think is the better way to store data between outgoing port calls (I will need it in port callbacks at JS side) - global vars or store it on Elm side (`Json.Encode.Value`) and then pass to port?,0
1743,Liberty,Leonardo: what are you trying to do exactly?,0
1743,Leonardo,Liberty: google maps for example. I have 2 ports `loadMap` and `setMarkers`. second port will need `map` instance from first port,0
1743,Leonardo,so when map is initializing within `loadMap` callback - I will need to store `map` instance somewhere. I can put it into something like `window.map` or send back to elm side and store inside my model,0
1743,Leonardo,and I am trying to find more idiomatic way of doing it,0
1743,Liberty,well that would absolutely be to store it in the model,0
1743,Liberty,global variables and pure functional languages don't play well together,0
1743,Leonardo,but js is not functional and I will use it on js side only :smile:,0
1743,Liberty,"sure, but using elm more and js less - especially for managing state - sounds like the better idea",0
1743,Leonardo,"yeah, sounds like a better way anyway :slightly_smiling_face:",0
1743,Sybil,Would it be a correct assumption that the `init` function usually resembles some branch of the `update` function as well?,0
1743,Sybil,Atleast that's the feeling I'm having :slightly_smiling_face:,0
1743,Liberty,"not always. if it's the case for you, create a separate function and call it from both init and update",0
1743,Sybil,Sure. Then it comes down to naming. That's the hardest part! :smile:,0
1743,Sybil,And where to keep this shared function,0
1744,Santa,Quick question: `import Polymer.Paper.IconButton as Paper.IconButton` gives me syntax error. Does it mean that I cannot have dot in a qualified import name?,0
1744,Liberty,yes,0
1745,Michelina,Do `Cmd` ports have any access to which embedded Elm application called them?,0
1745,Michelina,"That is, if I have more than one Elm app embedded on the page (likely, two copies of the same Elm app), and the app makes use of a port, can I somehow find out which instance (ie, which DOM node is associated) sent a command to the port?",0
1745,Janine,"Michelina: I would do that on the js side. When you subscribe to a port, you can build a function that contains an identifier of which elm app, something like (pseudo-code) ``` Elm.App1.subscribe(""myPort1"", buildHandler(""App1"")); Elm.App2.subscribe(""myPort2"", buildHandler(""App2"")); function buildHandler(appId) { return function(portData) { process(appId, portData); } } ``` Definitely pseudo-code, but you can do something like that.",0
1745,Michelina,I guess I could do that,0
1745,Janine,"As always, this could be an instance of the XY problem, so perhaps if you talked a bit more about what your problem is, there might be a different solution.",0
1745,Michelina,"I don't have any immediate problem to solve, but for my blog, I imagine having multiple elm applets running on a single page. Likely all close variants of each other, even being the same module with different parameters passed, as to build up to an idea I want to illustrate and talk about.",0
1745,Janine,<http://xyproblem.info/>,0
1745,Janine,I would probably build my initial idea if I was looking for a way to specify which app’s port was firing.,0
1745,Michelina,"Yes, I know what the phrase means. I just think it's a bad term for the notion.",0
1745,Janine,"Alas, it is the term we have. :slightly_smiling_face:",0
1745,Janine,"But, since the ports aren’t shared across apps, and you have to subscribe to them on the js side independently, I’d probably use my original idea",0
1745,Janine,If I wanted to have a single function that handled them the same.,0
1745,Michelina,Ahh. I forgot you have to wire them up manually anyway. Ack.,0
1745,Michelina,Yeah. That's something I need to take into account with my design.,0
1745,Janine,"Alternatively, you could pass an identifier into the init function, have that includes in all port calls.",0
1745,Janine,"That strikes me as a bit over-complicated, though.",0
1745,Janine,Also asks the elm app to be responsible for something that isn’t really relevant to itself,0
1745,Michelina,"Well, to be a little more concrete, I currently have a rough draft of a system where my blog posts are structured as xml files which specify which parts are Markdown and which parts are Elm, leaving me plenty of room to add things like LaTeX support, images, or other fun things",0
1745,Michelina,"It looks like `&lt;elm module=""Main""/&gt;` right now, which pulls in `Main.js` (compiled from `Main.elm`) and `Main.ports.js` if it exists",0
1745,Michelina,But it looks like I might need to actually try building something with multiple apps and non-trivial ports to see how I need to change my design.,0
1745,Michelina,and the one really important use case I know I'm going to need is the ability to track mouse movement and mouse clicks relative to each app,0
1745,Michelina,"I got some suggestions on how to do this the other day, but it's finally time for me to code it.",0
1745,Janine,sounds interesting.,0
1745,Margit,My advice is to not overthink it.,0
1745,Margit,Just dive in and you’ll find something that works.,0
1745,Michelina,Indeed.,0
1745,Michelina,"But at the same time, I want to get to a point where I can just drag&amp;drop my folder with the XML and the .js files (or ideally, the .elm files) and have it just kind of appear on my site",0
1745,Michelina,The old way I was doing things made it so tedious to actually upload anything that I never bothered :stuck_out_tongue:,0
1745,Michelina,What would you name a callback that subscribes to all the necessary ports... `subscribeToPorts()`? `installApplet()`? `wireItAllTogether()`?,0
1745,Margit,This counts as over-thinking it,0
1745,Margit,Go for whatever name makes best sense to you :slightly_smiling_face:,0
1745,Margit,"I would personally go for `subscribeToPorts` if it’s only subscribing to ports, since the other two names don’t make it clear what’s happening.",0
1745,Margit,But naming is very subjective,0
1745,Margit,names can be changed later :slightly_smiling_face:,0
1745,Michelina,it looks like app.ports will be undefined unless the module has at least one port. That seems like it should be useful.,0
1746,Michelina,"Well, I got the local mouse coordinates working pretty well. I just can't shake the nagging feeling that, ideally, this should all be expressible in pure elm code.",0
1746,Michelina,"It looks like the `elm-lang/mouse` library does it using the `Dom` module... but the `Dom` module looks a bit underdeveloped currently. At the very least, the embedded elm instance doesn't get a reference to the very DOM element it has been embedded in.",0
1746,Margit,Use a `mousemove` event.,0
1746,Margit,The mouse package is intended to be used for mouse position relative to the window.,0
1746,Arica,"hey everyone, does anyone have experience deploying an elm project on github pages?",0
1746,Margit,Yes,0
1746,Janine,"Arica: I’ve done it once. Since an Elm app is compiled into javascript, you can host both your html page and the js file and just include it as normal.",0
1746,Janine,Are you running into issues?,0
1746,Margit,That’s how <http://json2elm.com> is hosted,0
1746,Arica,"yes. i made a small one pager with elm-mdl that holds a crude sample resume. i've been using elm reactor up till now. I followed these intructions <https://jasonneylon.wordpress.com/2015/11/08/quickly-create-github-io-pages-for-your-elm-projects/> to try it out on github pages but when i visit the site, I just get the default readme",0
1746,Janine,"If you are getting the default readme, then this is probably an issue with your configuration for github pages, rather than an elm issue.",0
1746,Janine,"I would recommend making a static index.html and have it just say “Hello, world”",0
1746,Janine,Get that working first,0
1746,Janine,"Then, once you have that, you’ll know that you configuration is good. Then you can include the js file",0
1746,Margit,Follow this: <https://pages.github.com/>,0
1746,Arica,<https://github.com/tkshill/tkshill.github.io> is my repo. It's a bit raw. I threw everything up there (dont even have a proper gitignore yet),0
1746,Arica,i followed that for the github process i think. I'll take another look though.,0
1746,Margit,<https://tkshill.github.io/>,0
1746,Janine,You’ll need to compile the js file,0
1746,Margit,works for me,0
1746,Margit,Yeah. You need to check in the compiled JS,0
1746,Janine,"Oh, this is the index.html that elm make generates",0
1746,Margit,You are deploying the _end_ result of your build process,0
1746,Janine,That explains it,0
1746,Janine,"So, looking at it, you did an `elm make` and checked in the index.html",0
1746,Janine,It is there and appears to be working fine,0
1746,Margit,"Oh, I see",0
1746,Arica,"actually... yeah, it's working now. strange,",0
1746,Margit,Arica: The readme will always be the README,0
1746,Margit,"On the github repo page - it will never show index.html, it will show the README",0
1746,Janine,Although I’d highly recommend switching to something like `elm make Main.elm --out elm.js` and then include that in a static html page,0
1746,Arica,I... normally dislike when things start working and I don't know why.,0
1746,Margit,You have to go to <https://tkshill.github.io/> to see the index.html,0
1746,Margit,<https://github.com/tkshill/tkshill.github.io> -&gt; README.md <https://tkshill.github.io/> -&gt; index.html,0
1746,Arica,"So... next I should compile to elm.js, and refer to that in my index.html file?",0
1746,Janine,I’d recommend that,0
1746,Margit,"Eh, you don’t really need to",0
1746,Janine,"Yeah, you don’t have to",0
1746,Janine,"If this is just a resume site like this, could be simpler to just keep index.html",0
1746,Janine,"But, if you are building something larger, could be good to separate them out.",0
1746,Margit,You can if you want to. It can be handy if you want to do some fancy html things like put stuff in the head.,0
1746,Janine,"But, of course, context",0
1746,Arica,Cool. Thank you both. I've come to elm from a few years in python. And a few months dabbling in haskell but never managing to be very useful.,0
1746,Margit,"But it’s not needed, and I personally avoid it unless I really need a seperate index.html :slightly_smiling_face:",0
1746,Arica,the project will eventually expand.,0
1746,Janine,"Margit: Opengraph stuff, etc, in the head (as mentions) would need to have your own index.html that references the js",0
1746,Janine,"If you are just learning, I’d probably recommend it just as a next step.",0
1746,Janine,Get used to that.,0
1746,Arica,"Elm is pretty brilliant (I've never enjoyed debugging before), but I'm new to serious web dev and front end design.",0
1746,Janine,Welcome!,0
1746,Janine,Elm is a great way to get into it.,0
1746,Janine,I’ve been working in Elm for a little over a year now. Loving it.,0
1746,Arica,"My brief experience with javascript... gave me VBA flashbacks. elm reminds me of python from the practicality standpoint, but you know... delightfully static.",0
1746,Janine,:slightly_smiling_face:,0
1746,Janine,One of my first contracts was building an app in Excel in VBA :slightly_smiling_face:,0
1746,Janine,"Back in about 94. Built a small relational database. :slightly_smiling_face: (of course, we are getting into <#C0CJ671HU|random> channel territory here, so I’ll pause)",0
1746,Arica,"Margit: Janine: indeed, thank you again and",0
1746,Janine,"Oh, looking at your repo, might I recommend you pull everything into `Main.elm` for now. Don’t prematurely pull things out into `Types.elm` and `Views.elm`",0
1746,Arica,I kind of really like pulling it apart though... it forced me to get used to the import system. and there's quite a bit on the way.,0
1746,Arica,"I originally wanted the resume to be a json file that i would decode, but i wasnt sure how to configure the http request when working locally",0
1746,Arica,"I figured out the decoders, but I typically work locally, and wasnt how the http requests would work to get to the file.",0
1746,Janine,"My one recommendation is to wait until things force you separate them out, so you get a sense of how you want to extract things. For example, I’m not a fan of the `Types.elm` `Views.elm` etc extractions. I prefer to extract modules around data structures.",0
1746,Margit,Use `python3 -m http.server` and serve the json locally.,0
1746,Janine,"So, prematurely picking an extraction style might calcify before developing the feeling for yourself.",0
1746,Janine,"But, as with everything, when you are learning, it is probably one of the lesser of important things. :slightly_smiling_face:",0
1746,Arica,"I see your point. I read as many docs as I could on abstraction style before I started, and checked through some of the popular repos. In the end, this one seemed to make sense for this small project, but I'm not committed to keeping if if it grows a bit more.",0
1746,Arica,Janine: do you have an example of the structure that you mentioned?,0
1746,Arica,Margit: I'll look into that.,0
1746,Arica,"for now, the elm type mimics the structure I'd like, but json will let me be a lot more flexible with the data (next step is looking into exporting a pdf from the site)",0
1746,Janine,"I don’t really have an example to show. But, I generally start with a file, then, start grouping the types and records and functions together that seem to work on a similar thing, then, eventually those move into a module with a name around the domain concept.",0
1746,Janine,Let me look at your repo for a second,0
1746,Janine,"Just a cursory glance, i wouldn’t be surprised if I ended up with a `Resume.elm` that contained the type alias. That module would then contain the views associated with displaying it. It would also potentially include the decoders for pulling it out of the json.",0
1746,Janine,That would be the start,0
1746,Janine,"Then, as it grew, I would start noticing other structures.",0
1746,Janine,"In this case, since it is a read-only thing, nothing too interactive, then you aren’t going to have a lot of functions associated with manipulating the resume. If there were, they would go there.",0
1746,Janine,"I like to group things together based on how related they are in the domain, rather than how related they are by programming language feature",0
1746,Janine,"When I’m going into the system to work on it, I’m usually thinking “I want to work on things around the Resume” rather than “I want to work on something with Types”",0
1746,Janine,"So, I like things related to Resume to be together",0
1746,Arica,"hmm. I'm so used to MVC architecture... so I immediately thought Model (core types), Views (views) with 'controller' facilitated by elm itself.",0
1746,Janine,Understandable totally,0
1746,Janine,This is why I mentioned pulling everything back into a single file until you feel the pressure to pull some stuff out into a module. It helps break out of other architectural mindsets.,0
1746,Janine,If you think “I want to extract some modules” then old habits come in when there isn’t much guidance,0
1746,Janine,I try to only extract a module when I am doing it as a form of refactoring.,0
1746,Arica,"Yeah. I think most of my mental resistance is just me considering the sunk costs of the time i spent figuring out how to pull it all out... which rationally, shouldn't weigh on my decision to pull back.",0
1746,Janine,"So, I have a bunch of functions that like ``` resumeX resumeY doSomethingelseToResume ``` and I say to myself “that’s duplicate code, the knowledge that these work on Resume” so I eliminate that duplication by grouping them in `Resume.elm` and removing `Resume` from their name",0
1746,Janine,Consider it that you’ve learned a lot about building modules and importing them. That skill will come in VERY handy when you extract something out for real,0
1746,Janine,"One of the great things about deleting learning stuff is that it almost always is less than optimal. If you delete it, then you don’t have to live with it later.",0
1746,Janine,"And who knows, you might end up liking that structure. It seems like there are people who do structure their stuff that way.",0
1746,Janine,I’m a big fan of deleting things I’ve done and starting over,0
1746,Janine,I even wrote a blog post about it. #shamelessplug <http://articles.coreyhaines.com/posts/short-lived-branches>,0
1746,Arica,that... gets easier with practice. one of the hang ups of the beginner life is that every line seems so much more precious. I spent hours understanding some of the pipes... I don't want to lose them. But what you're saying is exactly what I told my interns learning python for the first time.,0
1746,Janine,:slightly_smiling_face: definitely,0
1746,Janine,"Arica: Well, I’m off to get a porter-infused milkshake. Welcome to Elm, ! It is a wonderful way to write software!",0
1746,Arica,"Janine: for the first time, i dont feel like i'm stepping in a mine field learning web development my brain is glad, my heart rejoices. have a good night.",0
1747,Clarinda,"This is probably a question that has been beaten to death. Is there a good way to do drag and drop. Basicaly my interface looks like this (<http://imgur.com/a/XYqBL>) and I want to be able to drag (to reorder) the lists, as well as the list items, which can also be dragged between lists.",1
1747,Norma,there’s a couple of dragdrop packages on <http://package.elm-lang.org/> otherwise you can always write your own like this: <https://github.com/mordrax/cotwelm/blob/master/src/Utils/DragDrop.elm>,0
1747,Norma,"mine was inspired by React DnD ( great design, very hard to debug errs… ), in contrast, i spent a few days 2 weeks into Elm to write it and it’s been solid ever since",0
1747,Clarinda,"Norma: thanks, I fear is most example are only dragging on type of item and I have two (one being nested)",0
1747,Clarinda,so updating the model also seems difficult,0
1747,Clarinda,That's a problem outside of drag and drop though,0
1747,Norma,"i drag items which are a union type, and inside, they hold composite records… the dragdrop module is flexible enough to allow different ‘types’ of things to be dragged",0
1747,Norma,e.g: <https://github.com/mordrax/cotwelm/blob/b72efbb428a6d190ff8a8a9ba61638efa2b8e89e/src/Inventory.elm#L51>,0
1747,Clarinda,"Alright, I'll take a look at it.",0
1747,Norma,"then when you drop it off, you need to handle which ( of the two types ) you need to update in your model",0
1747,Norma,"if you’re looking at my version, it might be useful to have a quick read of react-dnd, esp dragsource and droptarget, i found the concept to be really great and it would explain my code alot better than me or looking at the code ( <https://react-dnd.github.io/react-dnd/docs-drag-source.html> )",0
1747,Norma,it’s a layer that abstracts what you’re dragging (html) from where (source) to where (html) into what (target),0
1747,Clarinda,"okay, I'll give that a read too.",0
1747,Clarinda,"I'm a little surprised this hasn't been abstracted into something painstakingly easy to do yet. I would think that it's such a common problem, it could be generalized over.",0
1747,Norma,"check out the elm packages, there’s a few of them, i haven’t tried them yet, haven’t needed to",0
1747,Clarinda,will do,0
1748,Rolf,does anyone have a clean way to write a msg where i can just specify what item in the model i want a textinput to update?,1
1748,Rolf,i normally use ID's but i want something a bit more generic,0
1748,Mina,Thanks!,0
1748,Lorinda,"Rolf: , I do something like `type Field = Username | Password` `Type Message = UpdateField Field String | ..`",0
1748,Rolf,hmm,0
1748,Rolf,so you would still have to specify a case in the update for explicit types,0
1748,Rolf,thanks though,0
1749,Laraine,"couple of days ago i asked here in chat - about a performance problem i had with the compiler. I was having all my update logic directly inside my update function. No helpers. Compilation took around 8-12 seconds on each save. Now, i build this update helpers - and the compile time is almost ZERO. So in my experience, it matters to not have everything inside update. (I don't have any big tuples - just some nested dict updates ). Anyway, i think is useful know this - especially if you notice it takes longer to compile. :simple_smile:",0
1749,Joni,"Yeah, sometimes that works, sometimes that doesn't - there are a lot of factors that influence compile times, and those factors tend to shift around between releases :slightly_smiling_face:",0
1749,Joni,"sometimes you end up with a helpers file that is referenced basically everywhere, and that can actually slow you down because every module that uses it, needs to be recompiled whenever you touch those helpers... Having simple, clear functions that do one thing does tend to make life easier, though, and having `update` act as a dispatcher more than anything is always nice, lessens the mental burden, too",0
1749,Laraine,hmm interesting .. also i think if one puts the update helpers inside another module - and only use them in the update main module - no other places - the problem you say will be solved. And for the shared helpers - use a specialized `shared` module. So when working only with update logic - all other modules will not be impacted. good to know :smile:,0
1750,Nida,Anyone working on adding effect types a'la Koka to Elm?,0
1750,Liberty,Nida: most likely not. Elm intentionally has a very simple type system,0
1750,Nida,Seeing that it already has row/label polymorphism for records inspired by Leijen it looks like the natural next step to to take,0
1750,Nida,The type system wouldn't need to be changed much,0
1750,Liberty,"elm is a little atypical: to add something to the language, an actual compelling use case is needed, rather than ""it would not be a lot of work to add feature x"". So, how would those effect types make creating interactive web apps easier/nicer?",0
1750,Liberty,taking into consideration that the benefits have to outweigh that we have to teach beginners how it works,0
1750,Liberty,"The answer to those questions is not immediately clear for a lot of fancy type stuff, and so elm has put off extending the type system",0
1750,Nida,I just wondered if someone else besides me is interested in it,0
1750,Joni,"hadn't heard about koka before, looks like something I'll have to investigate",0
1750,Michelina,It looked pretty neat. I remember seeing it a few years ago on reddit.,0
1750,Michelina,"I remember it had a particularly simple effect system. If any effect system would be Elm-ish, it would be that one.",0
1750,Michelina,"(In my experience, effect systems can very easily grow to to become monsters. I spent a few months learning DDC aka ""Disciple"" and... dear god)",0
1750,Liberty,"it looks neat on paper, are there examples of larger programs using the effects now?",0
1750,Nida,The madoko markdown editor is written in it,0
1750,Nida,(which was around already when the popl-paper was written),0
1750,Nida,Here's the paper btw: <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/algeff.pdf>,0
1750,Liberty,any particular part of the editor that is interesting? most seems pure functions or IO,0
1751,Elfrieda,"Hi there,",0
1751,Elfrieda,Got a question that Google isn't helping me with so far :slightly_smiling_face: I need to select all text when a text input get's focus. Can I do that in pure Elm or do I need to use a port for that?,0
1751,Joni,"I don't think there's a `setSelectionRange` type thing in Elm, triggering that over a port when an element gets focus is probably your best bet atm :slightly_smiling_face:",0
1751,Elfrieda,Joni: Thanks,0
1752,Sade,"I'm diving in elm code after 2 week break, it's so easy to get back into, I don't need to re-create a full mental image of the app, I can just continue where I left.",0
1752,Sade,"I read there way no ""official support"", but do you know what is the elm browser support?",0
1752,Sade,"And if some browser is not supported, can we easily polyfill it? I saw somewhere that Object.assign was necessary.",0
1752,Joni,"Compiler compiles to ~ES3, mostly. RequestAnimationFrame is also used, but has a builtin fallback.",0
1752,Joni,"I don't think Object.assign is used at all, or at least not in core+vdom",0
1752,Sade,Apparently it is used only in dev tools (searching the mailing list now). So I guess it's safe.,0
1752,Sade,"But I guess it would help to throw ""wide browser support"" somewhere on the elm home page. I am working with a lot of enterprises still under IE 9.",0
1752,Kerri,"The bleeding edge, apparently",0
1752,Joni,"oh, indeed, elm-hot-loader (which I also encountered on my GH search) seems to be about the only thing, but that's only tangential anyway",0
1752,Sade,Yeah,0
1753,Leonardo,"Hi folks! What do you think is the best way to make a tree-like structure? I have this types ```type alias AreasTree = { id : String , name : String , path : String , children : AreasTreeChildren } type AreasTreeChildren = AreasTreeChildren (List AreasTree) ``` and get just a plain list via API where `path` is a key like `a.b.c`",1
1753,Leonardo,at the end I want tree like AreasTree(a) -&gt; children (AreasTree(b)) -&gt; children(AreasTree(c)),0
1753,Leonardo,"I think fold will fit my needs, but I am not sure what is the best way to put `c` for example into nested structure",0

1757,Ervin,Hi everyone! Does anyone have a very basic example of searchable. What I mean by searchable is I have a list of records listed by name and the list shows the results according to what is typed in the box (showing the number of records that match what is entered).,0
1757,Leida,`List.filter (\record -&gt; String.contains (String.toUpper model.searchString) (String.toUpper .name record)) recordList`,0
1757,Leida,This would return a new `recordList` where the `name` contains a substring of `model.searchString`,0
1757,Leida,Just populate `model.searchString` from an `onInput` of the searchbox,0
1757,Soraya,"Ervin: in terms of UI, this is basically an autocomplete control, isn't it?",0
1757,Ervin,"Yes, I am looking for something similar to elm-searchable-menu, but looking for a straight forward example",0
1757,Leida,"Ervin: : You'd want to store a `recordList` and the `searchString` in your model and then apply the `List.filter ...` line above at some point in your view before displaying the list of records.

1758,Margit,elm-reactor uses the elm-package.json closest to the source file you use,0
1758,Margit,delete that and you should be good to go :slightly_smiling_face:,0
1758,Erika,WOOO,0
1758,Erika,it worked,0
1758,Erika,i probably ran it inside src at one point and it generated that,0
1758,Margit,"Yeah, easy mistake to make",0
1758,Erika,how do you humans break up your Msg when you start getting a lot of them? I have almost 15 now and I feel like it's going to grow out of proportion,0
1758,Dudley,"Erika: Mine are broken into modules. However, I wouldn't say 20-30 is necessarily... something that needs to be broken up, unless you feel like you want to break them up (if there's a clear distinction by which you can separate them and it would make maintenance easier)",0
1758,Dudley,"Might be that you just need to break up your update function? (i.e. into several separate functions, possibly even modules)",0
1758,Erika,yeah I have actions I'd much rather limit to players,0
1758,Erika,"that sounds like a potential solution, how do you break up your update function?",0
1758,Dudley,"Well, step 1 would be to separate the logic into smaller functions (if it's all inline in the update function currently)",0
1758,Micheline,I like to extract everything in my `update` to other functions so that `update` is just dispatching,0
1758,Dudley,"that is, something like: ``` case msg of PlayerMessage1 -&gt; handlePlayerMessage1 -- (or whatever you want to call it) PlayerMessage2 -&gt; handlePlayerMessage2 OtherMessage -&gt; handleOtherMessage ```",0
1758,Dudley,(and obviously you wrangle your parameters there however you need to as well),0
1758,Dudley,"Then, if you have too much to fit in a single file, you can split the player message handler functions into a `Player.Update` module",0
1758,Erika,I might do that,0
1758,Erika,thanks,0
1758,Dudley,No problem! :slightly_smiling_face:,0
1758,Micheline,Erika: you can see what it looks like in a larger app: <https://github.com/rtfeldman/elm-spa-example/blob/master/src/Main.elm#L224>,0
1758,Micheline,note that this means you need to use `Cmd.map` and `Html.map` to make sure your types line up,0
1758,Erika,Ok I'll look more into that project,0
1758,Micheline,There's an accompanying blog post explaining the source: <https://dev.to/rtfeldman/tour-of-an-open-source-elm-spa>,0
1758,Dudley,Now here's another question: Does anybody have a good/recommended way of dealing with elm-package dependencies in CI/CD environments?,0
1758,Sunny,the package file enforces semantic versioning so it's all good,0
1758,Margit,"Eh, not quite.",0
1758,Margit,Dudley: You can use `3.0.0 &lt;= v &lt; 3.0.1` to lock it to a version,0
1758,Margit,that’s what I did at NRI.,0
1758,Dudley,"Hmm... well I have an app that currently compiles using webpack, and we have a CD script that just runs npm build and then copies the build to S3. But I just added a new package to `elm-package.json` and it bombed, saying it couldn't find the new package (because I hadn't run elm-package install as part of the build)",0
1758,Margit,"Sunny: patch changes can still break site functionality, due to logic changes.",0
1758,Margit,"Dudley: oh, you just need to run elm-package on your CI",0
1758,Dudley,"Okay, so you do run it during CI and CD? So then normally it will ask me to approve a plan, and I see there is an option `-y` to auto-accept the prompt, which seems to work, but... is that safe?",0
1758,Dudley,"The only other option I can think of I guess is to check elm-stuff into the repo, which seems silly. I was expecting there to me something analogous to Gemfile.lock (from rails)",0
1758,Dudley,"So that I could handle that prompt manually (if necessary), and then just allow CI/CD to install the same versions without asking again...",0
1758,Margit,Yes,0
1758,Margit,it is safe.,0
1758,Dudley,But I guess I don't *really* know what that prompt is for. (Like... it's either yes or no right? it's not like I have other choices of what to install),0
1758,Dudley,Okay :slightly_smiling_face:,0
1758,Margit,As long as you’ve locked the deps down like I said,0
1758,Margit,Otherwise it will install newer packages when they get released,0
1758,Dudley,"Ah, sure, right... I guess that makes the difference.",0
1758,Leonardo,"Micheline: Sunny: ok, I am done ellie with example code <https://ellie-app.com/3zVTgFLNprxa1/3> :slightly_smiling_face:",0
1758,Leonardo,"so it looks like I should have some kind of recursion inside `insertItem` function, right?",0
1758,Dudley,"Doesn't the make updating a little annoying though? Like, then for each library you have to extend the max number as far as you want, run an install, see where it ends up and constrain it to the new version manually?",0
1758,Micheline,Leonardo: I think there are three cases: 1) the current node is not an ancestors 2) the current node is an ancestor 2) the current node is the parent,0
1758,Sunny,Leonardo: datastructures in elm are immutable so thing about how you would go about constructing a new tree with one new element in it,0
1758,Micheline,"You will want to map over the list, and check the three cases",0
1758,Thanh,"Erika: I'd also consider breaking it up only when it actually /is/ a problem, rather than when it feels like one. The thing is that the big update case statement isn't that hard to parse or search, and it's super-easy to re-factor or hoist out functions if it really does get complicated. If you're feeling the urge because it feels like a really long function, think of it insted as just a bunch of separate functions, because that's actually closer to what it is..",0
1758,Leonardo,"yep, I am imagine if it will be easier to have a fake root node so `a` will be child of this root",0
1758,Dudley,Margit: Wait a minute... - should I just be checking in `elm-stuff/exact-dependencies.json`?,0
1758,Sunny,Is this a balanced tree or are you trying to attach nodes to a specifc location,0
1758,Margit,"Dudley: No, don’t do that.",0
1758,Leonardo,Micheline: map inside `insertItem`?,0
1758,Margit,"That is not for you to check in, and can break things if it is checked in",0
1758,Dudley,Oh. Dang :slightly_smiling_face: Okay.,0
1758,Micheline,"Leonardo: I'm thinking something like: ``` insertItem : Item -&gt; Tree -&gt; Tree insertItem item tree = if parentOf item tree then appendChild item tree else if ancestorOf item tree List.map (insertItem item) tree.children -- make this return a Tree, not a list else tree ```",0
1758,Leonardo,so have a root node is a good idea? :slightly_smiling_face:,0
1758,Micheline,All trees must have a root node :slightly_smiling_face:,0
1758,Leonardo,"ok, ty. let me some time to figure out how it works :smile:",0
1759,Elnora,"Hi, I would love some feedback on a little game I made. <https://ellie-app.com/3zW9S8VjvSVa1/0>",0
1759,Dudley,Elnora: Hmm - doesn't seem to compile... ?,0
1760,Elnora,"Hmm, sorry. Try again? <https://ellie-app.com/3zW9S8VjvSVa1/2>",0
1760,Elnora,"BTW, I came across this game at a science center yesterday. I've yet to solve it (move all the frogs to the other side)",0
1760,Elnora,"But I thought it might help me to learn Elm, think about state, explore new modules, etc.",0
1760,Dudley,"Ah! Interesting :smile: Hmm, when I click on Frog 2 at the beginning of the game, it doesn't do what I'd expect",0
1760,Dudley,(move the open space to space 2),0
1760,Elnora,Frogs can only jump over one other frog to get to empty space or move to immediately adjacent space.,0
1760,Dudley,"Sorry, I mean the Frog in Space 2",0
1760,Elnora,"Sorry, I should have more boilerplate about the rules and goals.",0
1760,Dudley,(that one should be able to jump right?),0
1760,Elnora,"Yes, Frog 2 should be able to leap over 3 to get to the space in slot 4 (all assuming 0-based indexing)",0
1760,Dudley,"kyclark: Okay, yeah (Right, I'm just using the numbers as labeled on the spaces). Looks like it is instead moving the Frog in space 3 for some reason.",0
1760,Elnora,Solution: <http://britton.disted.camosun.bc.ca/frog_puzzle_sol.htm>,0
1760,Elnora,I think I should make a version with 2-4 frogs to warmup!,0
1760,Elnora,"Oh, and I should add a counter to keep track of how many moves.",0
1760,Dudley,I think line 120 is where the bug is,0
1760,Dudley,"Should be `[ Space, y, x ]` right?",0
1760,Leonardo,"Micheline: why `List.map (insertItem item) tree.children -- make this return a Tree, not a list` is here?",0
1760,Leonardo,"I thought things like `appendChild` should return a `Tree` instance then, no?",0
1760,Leonardo,and in such case branch 1 returning `Tree` and branch 2 `List Tree`,0
1760,Dudley,(and Also line 132?),0
1760,Elnora,"OK, I'm going to really think about those lines. I'm not at all sure I have the logic correct.",0
1760,Dudley,":smile: (Mostly I just noticed that when I click the frog, the wrong frog moves! Hehe)",0
1760,Elnora,"Yes, you are correct! Thanks bigly",0
1760,Dudley,:laughing: Any time!,0
1760,Dudley,"Oh, interesting - almost had it solved, but I just noticed that when I get the last right-frog to Space 1, (with space 0 open) I can't move it over for some reason. Must be some small logic error there too...",0
1760,Dudley,"(possibly `slots` isn't what you're expecting it to be, since it's usually the frog and the two spaces in front of it, but that frog only has 1 space in front of it?)",0
1760,Elnora,"Yes, I was just seeing this, too. It helped me to 1) find the solution and 2) step through with only 3 frogs. I need to iron out that bug.",0
1760,Micheline,"Leonardo: yeah, my comment there was to say return a `Tree`, not a `List Tree` in branch 2",0
1760,Micheline,Branch 2 would actually look like: ``` Tree { tree | children = (List.map (insertItem item) tree.children) } ```,0
1760,Leonardo,"Micheline: ah, got it. thanks! just didn't fully understood comment :slightly_smiling_face:",0
1760,Leonardo,will try it now,0
1760,Leonardo,and parentOf/ancestorOf checks if item is parent/ancestor of tree or reversed?,0
1760,Micheline,It checks if the item should be a direct child of the tree,0
1760,Leonardo,Micheline: and `ancestorOf` is not for direct ancestor right? just any ancestor?,0
1760,Micheline,Correct. Non-direct ancestor (direct is checked by the parentOf function),0
1760,Leonardo,"hmm, should it be in reversed order than?",0
1760,Leonardo,"ah, no",0
1760,Leonardo,sorry :slightly_smiling_face:,0
1760,Leonardo,"oh god, looks like it working :smile:",0
1760,Leonardo,<https://ellie-app.com/3zYfQbMWvMKa1/0>,0
1760,Leonardo,I am not sure if `unwrapChildren` is the best I can do for self-referenced type alias,0
1760,Leonardo,<https://ellie-app.com/3zYfQbMWvMKa1/1> - I think this is more expressive,0
1760,Leonardo,really thank you a lot :slightly_smiling_face:,0
1761,Ervin,"Soraya: Leida: Hi again. I am still working at creating a select2 (single select -<https://select2.github.io/examples.html>). I got the search box working, thanks to and . Now, I need to implement that clicking on a li will actually select the item just like for select2, and close the searching div. Has anyone implemented something similar or has examples, especially simple examples to start with?",0
1761,Michelina,Is there a way to install elm packages in a system-wide fashion?,0
1761,Elnora,"Much better, but probably not perfect: <https://github.com/kyclark/elm/blob/master/frogs/Main.elm>",0
1761,Johnson,Michelina: As in like NPM global? Isn’t that practice looked down upon these days?,0
1761,Kathline,Michelina: it's better to never install npm packages globally maybe you have a really specific usecase?,0
1761,Micheline,"Ervin: you'll want to add some `onClick` handlers to the `li`s, create a few more Msg types for selecting a value and opening the dropdown. Your model will need to track some extra state such as open/closed and what the selected value is",0
1761,Micheline,Here's a simple example: <https://ellie-app.com/3B3JQDgRCqga1/0>,0
1761,Ervin,"Micheline: Thanks a lot, it is very helpful!",0
1761,Micheline,Glad to help :slightly_smiling_face:,0
1761,Micheline,good luck with your project,0
1761,Ervin,Micheline: Thanks!,0
1762,Michelina,Johnson: Kathline: It feels like a waste to have to redownload and recompile every time. Especially if everything is semantically versioned. That's a big difference between what npm does and what a typed language should be able to do.,0
1762,Michelina,"But if it's not possible, oh well. It was just a curiosity",0
1762,Glenn,The reason behind chrome showing the JSON instead of the page has to do with the fact that I was differentiating between the 2 on the backend. So chrome sees the same URL and caches it wrongly. I specifically added `.json` to the URL and now it doesn’t happen anymore.,0
1762,Kathline,Michelina: you can use yarn it's a lot of faster than npm,0
