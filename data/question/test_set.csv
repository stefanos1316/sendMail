Full code editing would require literally throwing out vscode's editor and using a custom one however, since it's quite strict about what you can do within a vanilla text editor.; This is *definitely* a path I feel needs pursuing to it's fullest though, even if it means dropping vscode and building a dedicated electron application.; I never saw the Interlisp version of that, though I've read many times how friendly it was considered to be.

9_clojurians_2019,1546306659,Alix,"I'm confused about when to use what style of namespaced keys. I know how they work, I just don't know what is best from a maintainability standpoint. For example is `:user/email` a good namespaced key? Or should it be namespaced to the company such as `com.company.user/email`? Or perhaps namespaced to the project `com.company.project.user/email` or even a project file namespace such as `com.company.project.spec.user/email`. Should any way be used exclusively, or are there use cases where either style might be used? I'm thinking that `:user/email` still might result in naming collisions if two systems deal with `user` in a different way. I'm hoping to figure out an optimal solution for systems spanning many projects in an organisation.; I think I remember a Rich Hickey talk on this but I don't remember which one",1
9_clojurians_2019,1546307150,Rosaline,"project level is pretty good, I don't care very much for using the names of code namespaces for keyword namespaces; I think a good rule of thumb is to imagine all your data that exists in memory exists in a sql database, the namespaces would be the table names and the names would be the column names; and then imagine everyone's data is in the same global table space, and what would you need to name your tables to avoid collisions",0
9_clojurians_2019,1546307388,Alix,"When you say everyone's data, are you referring to company level namespace like `com.company.user/email`?",0
9_clojurians_2019,1546307430,Rosaline,"that would be one possible solution to that, prefixing all your table names with some string that you ""own""; another solution would be using uuids, which would work but are not very friendly",0
9_clojurians_2019,1546308638,Celestine,"Another factor to consider <@Alix> is how ""global"" your data is going to be. Is this just a map of data that will exist inside your company? Inside just this project? How unique does the name need to be?; If you produce it from a library you put out there for everyone to use, it needs to be ""more unique"" so that it can't conflict with any similar data used by any of the users of your library.",0
9_clojurians_2019,1546308844,Madeleine,And the issue was that it coupled our key names with the namespace;  So I'd say be careful about that,0
9_clojurians_2019,1546309733,Alix,"Right so it looks like there is no real convention around this. And I should just go with what makes the most sense given the factors.; Some examples:
If I need a db uri for my users db in my company I could namespace like this `:db.users/uri`. I wouldn't want to use `:db/uri` as I might have many databases in my company. I also didn't namespace to the company because this key will be accessed only within the company
And I could use `:user/email` if users in my company are global among all projects. But if my company had two products I would namespace the user attributes accordingly such as `:project1.user/email` &amp; `:project2.user/email` but only if some of the code was shared in any way.; That's where my thinking is after considering the feedback; <@Otelia> If there was 2 databases for users (employees, clients) then the business logic for dealing with the two types of users would probably be different. And the data is stored is two different places. To me this because of the 2 datasources, I would think to namespace to two separate namespaces. The namespace gives me the ability to inspect my data and decide if I want to do something with a client or an employee. And I can tell the difference because of the namespace. If there was no difference, then there would be no reason to store client &amp; employee separately or differently (with some technical exceptions such as security). Because they're essentially the same I would namespace them the same. I'm still working all this out but that's my thinking.; Yea that's something I've though about also. For example the namespaces seem redundant for this data structure `{:orgs [{:org/employees [{:employee/paychecks [{:paycheck/id 1}]}]}]}` because each level up contains the context. Perhaps the namespace allows you to avoid passing in the context or more information than that is needed. For a paycheck/id=1 instead of giving `{:employee/paychecks [{:paycheck/id 1}`, you just give `{:paycheck/id 1}` and the namespace allows you to determine the context.",0
9_clojurians_2019,1546313840,Otelia,I think you must be right.; But it would be interesting to know what specific benefits others have found for the unique keywords.,0
9_clojurians_2019,1546313976,Alix,Yea I'd like to know also. I've never written code like and I'd like to know if others how found it practical for production use; The most practical scenarios I can think of is dynamic spec validation. It could just lookup the spec for all its keys and avoid knowing any context apart from the keys; I've never done that though so I'm not sure how if at all it would work; Or even if it's a good idea. I feel like you would want to explicitly specify what spec you're validating against,0
9_clojurians_2019,1546314105,Otelia,"OTOH, a spec for :person/email would probably work for email addresses in all tables.",0
9_clojurians_2019,1546314191,Alix,"However you could still do that with unique keys and some mapping.; But your thinking raises another question for me. So far I've assumed that the namespace of keys in a map would be the same. Are there any use cases for them to be different? Perhaps what your suggesting might also be a correct way of doing this. `{:person/id ""123"" :person/name ""Caleb"" :employee/number ""001""}`; As long as there would be no way that the information stored in the shared keys would need to be handled differently I would think",0
9_clojurians_2019,1546314438,Otelia,"Yes, I've wondered about that. But I don't have enough experience in Clojure to say. Someone with more experience will probably chime in. I can admit that unique keywords give you the most flexibility for treating them differently, if necessary, just don't know specifically when it's necessary.",0
9_clojurians_2019,1546314483,Alix,Yea I agree. How far is too far. Perhaps there are times when you would use them and times when you wouldn't.,0
9_clojurians_2019,1546314718,Celestine,"When you're looking at nested data structures, remember that sometimes you'll just be passing part of it around -- so you don't always have the parental context.; Qualified keys are designed to ""avoid conflicts"" and to ""uniquely identify an entity in a given context"". So they really are about _context_.; For example, at work, we have a billing subsystem and we generally have all the keys in maps associated with billing qualified with `wsbilling`. The context we need to convey is that ""this data all belongs to billing"", so the maps within that system tend to have keys like `:wsbilling/member-id`, `:wsbilling/initial-amount` and so on -- unique within the context of billing and the systems that it interacts with.; Another part of the system deals with multiple ""layers"" of domain logic so it uses qualifiers that identify the different layers.",0
9_clojurians_2019,1546315081,Alix,"Right that makes sense. And expanding upon mixing namespaces in a map as I previously suggested. Looking back on work with datomic, your entities wouldn't contain maps with mixed namespaced keys. They would nest them under a ref.",0
9_clojurians_2019,1546315092,Celestine,"Some of these qualifiers match actual namespaces, some don't.",0
9_clojurians_2019,1546315111,Alix,So perhaps the second nesting would be better than mixing namespaces,0
9_clojurians_2019,1546315134,Celestine,"The idea is you use whatever qualifiers make sense for your data in your context. Making these ""as unique as they need to be"".",0
9_clojurians_2019,1546315201,Alix,<@Celestine> And would the use of qualifiers matching actual namespaces be almost exclusively used for keywords private to the namespace? Are there other reasons you might do this?,0
9_clojurians_2019,1546315205,Celestine,(which is why there are no specific rules of thumb about this whole thing :slightly_smiling_face: ),0
9_clojurians_2019,1546315447,Alix,Yea Clojure is very interesting in that regard. It's like the complete opposite of something opinionated like ruby on rails. Everyone sort of does what works for them. It does make it a little difficult if you're new however as its hard to copy what other people do because everyone does it so differently. I imagine it's an experienced developers dream though as they can do everything exactly how they like it.,0
9_clojurians_2019,1546315472,Celestine,"It means you need to understand more of the abstractions and concepts, yes.",0
9_clojurians_2019,1546315791,Nova,"<@Alix> It's more so that people program with abstractions, and the concrete code that comes out varies",0
9_clojurians_2019,1546315820,Otelia,"Thanks Sean, I see your point about nested data structures. And it is good to know that there is no standard convention.

Another question: If you have both :employee/email and :client/email, don't you sometimes want to treat all emails the same or similarly, and in that case do you use the keyword name to identify it as an email? Just curious if you'd encountered that situation.",0
9_clojurians_2019,1546316157,Alix,<@Nova> That blows my mind a little bit. When deciding on how to implement something I've usually started by figuring out what worked for me in the past or finding out what other people have done. Pretty much just lots of practice. Perhaps to improve myself I should spend some more time reading up on the theory.,0
9_clojurians_2019,1546316481,Nova,"<@Alix> It's not so much about theory, as much as it's about understanding 'what needs to happen'",0
9_clojurians_2019,1546316499,Celestine,"<@Otelia> If you've named them `:employee/email` and `:client/email` it'll generally be because you want to be able to tell them apart in a particular context. If you want to do something email-generic, you can pass either value to a function that just takes ""an email address"" or you can construct a new map containing the bits you might want under more generic names.; When you get into specs, you also have to consider whether these fields have the same underlying spec or not.",0
9_clojurians_2019,1546316551,Nova,"<@Alix> I find that when programming in Lisps, especially clojure, I rarely need to think about writing code. I spend most of my time thinking about architecture or specification. I find this also leads to better applications.",0
9_clojurians_2019,1546316573,Celestine,"For example, your spec for `:employee/email` might be a regex that has a fixed `@` domain name part (for your company).; <@Alix> Clojure certainly rewards thinking at a higher level of abstraction a lot of the time... and can punish thinking at a lower level sometimes :slightly_smiling_face:",0
9_clojurians_2019,1546316716,Nova,"<@Celestine> I feel like that's a bit unfair, because the flexibility of the language allows you to do far-reaching optimizations with lower-level code changes. Perhaps more accurate to say that Clojure punishes premature optimization more than other languages?",0
9_clojurians_2019,1546317029,Otelia,"My takeaway from this conversation is that I am free to use keyword namespaces for whatever purpose is most suited to my app, which turns the focus back to the app data model. It's a nice freedom. Thanks everyone for the comments and help.",0
9_clojurians_2019,1546317164,Alix,Likewise thank you for the help,0
9_clojurians_2019,1546317298,Celestine,"<@Nova> OK, yeah, that's what I was reaching for really.; But also if you try to dive in and think about problems the way you might in other languages -- where mutable variables and loops are the basic building blocks -- you'll find Clojure working against you.; So you often have to step back and think in terms of collections rather than elements, and abstractions rather than implementation, in order to get the ""shape"" of a Clojure solution.",0

27_clojurians_2019,1546450581,Jasmine,you have to be careful on some of those - filter is lazy and you aren’t forcing realization; so the first timing isn’t doing the filter at all; all of the other ops here are eager so will force realization; timing a single instance of any of these is also likely meaningless,0

- most of the time AOT compilation is not desirable
- ns-level forms are executed during AOT compilation, which is confusing
- the only reason why most people use AOT is to set the entry point for the uberjar so that you can `java -jar uberjar.jar` instead of the - often superior - `java -cp uberjar.jar -m foo.main`; The whole situation confuses people:

- people don't understand how gen-class works or why it's necessary
- leiningen warns and unnecessarily suggests that you should set `:aot :all` - which doesn't seem like a good default to me
- if you specify `:aot [foo.main]` explicitly, that works but due to a bug in lein it compiles the ns twice if you also set `:main foo.main` <https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/issues/2521>; Really all you want is to generate a class that does the equivalent of these two lines: <https://github.com/pesterhazy/lein-aot-example/blob/master/src/foo/main.clj#L7-L8>; AIUI most projects will be better off doing that than AOT'ing everything; ... given that the Clojure compiler is very fast, it doesn't blur the line between compile time and run time and other issues with AOT'ing; Is there something I'm missing here?",0

Question about concurrency: if i have two http requests (ring) coming in, in quick succession, I want to make sure that the first one can do some work, and block the second request for a little bit, and after the first request is done, the other can continue (it’s ok if the 2nd one takes a few milliseconds longer to succeed)

How should I go about this? I started out with a global `atom`, for simplicity let’s say it’s a boolean `busy?` which is `true` when it’s busy, and `false` otherwise

but how to ‘wait’ for the atom? I could of course make a spinning loop but that feels very dirty.

Which construct from clojure would be suitable?; more context: I am integrating with an oauth2 API, which requires me to refresh access tokens; the refreshing is done in a ring middleware; but if two calls to this api follow each other up quite quickly (which could happen) for the same user; and the first one is busy refreshing the token via a HTTP POST  call to the external API; then the second one will fail because the external api says: ‘you are using an outdated token’",1
56_clojurians_2019,1546684437,Venice,I think you're setting yourself up for a world of hurt trying to block that.,0
56_clojurians_2019,1546684457,Clarine,you could use `locking` if the user’s token is refreshing,0
56_clojurians_2019,1546684468,Kristine,aah thanks,0
56_clojurians_2019,1546684471,Clarine,but I’m not sure if that’s a good idea,0
56_clojurians_2019,1546684475,Kristine,<@Venice> why so?,0
56_clojurians_2019,1546684496,Venice,I'd say just let them receive the 401 and do the refresh dance.,0
56_clojurians_2019,1546684513,Clarine,it would be better to make it idempotent. so a second refresh just gets you the same token as the first refresh; you could make a local atom keeping the tokens and return the same token if it’s still valid,0
56_clojurians_2019,1546684548,Kristine,ah yea so move the problem to my clojurescript client,0
56_clojurians_2019,1546684591,Clarine,"I mean, cache the tokens server side. the refresh function goes through the cache",0
56_clojurians_2019,1546684699,Venice,"Yea, basically, catch the ""invalid token"" message at the clojurescript, do the dance to refresh it with the refresh token, then continue with whatever it was the client was actually requesting.",0

56_clojurians_2019,1546684826,Kristine,"one idea i also have, come to think of it, is to just retry. catch the refresh token outdated exception server-side, re-look in the database (which has a new token in a very short while) and retry; ok but i can work from here; thanks, i hoped there was some construct that did this for me, so that I came to check here.; thanks",0

56_clojurians_2019,1546684935,Kristine,"yeah; how would that help? i ’m integrating with an external api here that i don’t control; but i just realize the simple solution is staring me in the face:
- catch the ‘outdated token’ refresh action, and just proceed; there must ’ve been a previous request which done that",0
56_clojurians_2019,1546685047,Clarine,"<@Kristine> I have a similar construct with futures. I’m getting some data from a future and keep those futures in an atom. It doesn’t matter if the future is already realized or still running. If there is already a future, I just wait for that one. If there isn’t one, I create one.",0
56_clojurians_2019,1546685058,Kristine,ah yeah,0
56_clojurians_2019,1546685080,Clarine,"if the future is not valid anymore, I remove or cancel it",0
56_clojurians_2019,1546685084,Kristine,"yeah; gotcha; Decided to ‘keep it simple’. If the refresh failed due to outdated token (ie. race condition), wait 200ms, assume by now the new tokens are stored in the database by the previous request, re-fetch those (they should be valid anyway, since validity is 10minutes), and proceed the handler.; the only thing is the thread/sleep… but at least it’s very clear what’s happening. Not sure if this gives lots of problem when i have a gazillion concurrent users doing things like this, but I’ll come back here when that happens :wink:; as an aside: again realizing the middleware pattern is awesome. the business logic ring handlers are now simplified so much.",0
56_clojurians_2019,1546691961,Ellyn,"here’s a non-blocking way to do it: a function called `is-about-to-expire` and an atom `is-updating`, then in your request have something like this:
```
(if (and (is-about-to-expire token) (compare-and-set! is-updating false true))
  (try
    (swap! token-atom (get-new-token)))
    (finally
      (reset! is-updating false)))

68_clojurians_2019,1546799800,Cody,"Hey everyone, I have a problem with leiningen, reloaded.repl, Cursive and/or CLJC. I have defined some protocols in .cljc files which are used from clj/s. In an open REPL from Cursive, most of the time when using `reloaded.repl/reset(-all)`, it doesn't pick up my changes at all. If I do a ""manual"" `clojure.tools.namespace/refresh(-all)`, my changes are picked up but all the protocol implementations won't satisfy their respective (newly modified) protocols anymore, so I get exceptions from somewhere near `clojure.core/-cache-protocol-fn`. I need to fully restart the REPL for everything to be picked up again. Is there a way to remedy this, or workarounds? Has anybody encountered this? (my google searches haven't turned up much); (My workflow is roughly equivalent of what using chestnut involves)",0
68_clojurians_2019,1546800048,Meagan,"this sounds relevant: <https://lambdaisland.com/blog/2018-02-09-reloading-woes>
&gt; when you use tools.namespace to reload your code, it effectively creates completely new and separate versions of functions, records, multimethods, vars, even namespace objects, and any state that is left around from before the reload might still be referencing the old ones; I personally don’t use tools.namespace, but I know that re-evaluating things like multimethods is tricky; I wonder if records/types that implement protocols is the same; have you had any success simply re-evaluating the namespace you’re trying to refresh?",0
68_clojurians_2019,1546800457,Cody,"Well, sort of. It sends me on a wild goose chase through my namespaces, totally arbitrary and non-deterministic; Sooner or later it sometimes works, but not so often that restarting the whole thing isn't much easier and faster; Multimethods work fine, by the way; I have lots of `defrecords` implementing various protocols, and those very often ""loose"" their implementations in this way",0
68_clojurians_2019,1546800589,Meagan,"well, specifically, I always run into an issue where you can’t re-evaluate the `(defmulti &lt;dispatch&gt;)` part. re-evaluating the cases works fine :slightly_smiling_face:",0
68_clojurians_2019,1546800590,Cody,"which is a bummer since I quite like the architecture so far, but without proper refreshes in the REPL it's very frustrating; ah you're right, I know that one too ^^; Maybe it's reloaded.repl's alter-var-root! that does something funky?",0
68_clojurians_2019,1546800666,Meagan,"so, question: if you create a new instance of the new `defrecord` impl, do you see the correct behavior?; after a reload; (I’m also assuming that you’re interacting with this at a REPL to some extent)",0
68_clojurians_2019,1546800768,Cody,"iirc yes, if I switch to the respective namespace and manually instantiate the record, it satisfies the protocol; but let me check real quick; (most of the records are instantiated via an integrant like multimethod mechanism)",0
68_clojurians_2019,1546800866,Meagan,"so it sounds like what’s happening is that your `defrecord` is being picked up correctly, but your application is still referring to instances of the old implementations; I haven’t use integrant, I typically use mount because I’m lazy. but I assume there is a way to stop/start your system with new instances of your records, which would solve the problem you’re encountering I think?",0
68_clojurians_2019,1546801079,Cody,"i'm not using integrant, but the core of the IoC mechanism is a multimethod that's basically integrant's init-key; i'll look into the REPL utilities to see if there's something that keeps around stuff; I'd be surprised though since afaik there's one aliases and stuff. reloaded.repl uses alter-var-root! and component/suspendable, so in a reset, it'll call Lifecycle/stop. All the records in question are re-instantiated on start and discarded on stop. But there could be a bug there as well I suppose.; there's only aliases*",0
68_clojurians_2019,1546801285,Meagan,"hm. oh, so you’re using component?",0
68_clojurians_2019,1546801298,Cody,"yes, but only ""behind the scenes""; and really only for repl convience. all components wrap a subsystem which consists of the actual parts of the application; the wrapper components discard the subsystem on stop and create a fresh one through the IoC mechanism on start; which is why this protocol issue puzzles me; reloaded.repl's reset does stop, refresh, start, so in theory the subsystems should be created after the tools.namespace refresh; and with the new implementations; but maybe that's the crux, a combination of cljc processing and protocol/multimethod reloading; or protocol reloading and multimethod instantiation, rather; the reason I suspect something very messy is that very rarely everything breaks completely, even after a REPL restart, and I have to `lein clean` before any of it will work again :sweat_smile:",0
68_clojurians_2019,1546801685,Meagan,"hm yeah this all sounds very complex; FWIW I don’t use reloaded.repl at all. I use mount and re-evaluate the var or namespace I’m in as I develop.

69_clojurians_2019,1546821654,Meagan,"typically the way I end up writing my applications, is that different namespaces might declare different states. those states get introduced into my application at various entrypoints, and are passed around from that point on.

I find that mount pretty much solves the _reloading_ part of my issues, e.g. being in a dirty REPL and wanted to start/stop some resource that things are referring to.

it doesn’t really help you at all with architecting your application, since it allows you to be as strict or loose with how you reference those global states as you want; the upside is much less ceremony. but I haven’t been burned too badly yet, so I’m willing to pay that cost for now :wink:",0
69_clojurians_2019,1546822076,Celestine,"There's no ""One True Way"" in Clojure so you can use whatever approach suits you best -- but that also means there's not much guidance and nothing very opinionated, which can be hard when you're getting started.

86_clojurians_2019,1546889944,Rosaline,it depends; if you have a namespace and load the file via require then multiple loads won't result in new code generation; the naive approach of sending a string around and evaling it will,0

86_clojurians_2019,1546890201,Rosaline,it handles them as best it can; (which in my opinion is not very well); the problem with serializing arbitrary object graphs from memory (which closure serialization is) is pointer identity is not preserved; vars are sort of like pointers where the identity is preserved,0
86_clojurians_2019,1546890502,Somer,Not sure I totally understand. Is that a performance trade off or a different behavior than originally expected?,0

86_clojurians_2019,1546890988,Somer,I suppose that’s the trade off I’d be making with taking approach. <@Rosaline> you said you spend some time thinking of this. Was this the best solution you found?,0
86_clojurians_2019,1546891080,Rosaline,"there isn't a good general solution, so you should solve your specific problem; your specific problem is you have some clojure code you want to distribute; the best way to distribute clojure code is as code; (not serializing java objects from memory); there is some tool that people use for deploying clojure functions as aws lambdas, you might check that out (I forget the name); I have trouble believing it works well",0

86_clojurians_2019,1546893703,Jasmine,Thanks!; If only there was a way to register these issues for update,0
87_clojurians_2019,1546896360,Tammera,"<@Jasmine> Looking at some of the documentation I sometimes find myself puzzled at what is actually suggested. Take for example <https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/reduce-kv>, it tells me that it takes a function with three positions, an `f`/`init`/`coll` and that it applies f to `init`, `k1`, `v1`, and applies `f` to that result, `k2` and `v2`… etc.

This particular case tells me “how” and “what”, but forgets to tell “why”. It is actually, as a beginner in Clojure, surprisingly difficult to quickly find functions that I need due to these highly dense detailed pieces of documentation that “forget” to tell the higher picture.

Certainly written with great intention, and all information is there, but not usually in a very “yes this is what I want”/“no I don’t want this” kinda way. If that makes any sense?",0
87_clojurians_2019,1546896493,Jasmine,"That is pretty much by design. The docstrings are not intended to teach you the language, the idioms, etc of the language. They are meant to be concise statements about what each function does.; We don’t really have any intention to change that (and in fact, making these much longer and more explanatory would also increase code size and degrade classloading and startup time); However, it is perfectly reasonable to combine docstrings with ancillary material that is useful to one or more audiences into a documentation site that would be better for those audiences",0
87_clojurians_2019,1546896726,Tammera,"yeah ofc, they are pretty printed docstrings, I get that. I am merely saying that, as a beginner, that is often the only thing I have, and dumps quite a bit information on my “newbie” mind.",0
87_clojurians_2019,1546896731,Jasmine,"<http://clojuredocs.org/> is such a site - it combines the docstrings with examples, links, etc; some efforts that have been made in adding supplementary docstring material but it’s a big effort and one that’s hard to do well; maybe some day we will spend more time on this in the core team, but other things seem more pressing at the moment; there is a lot of intro Clojure material available in a variety of forms and I’d say all of them are a better way to learn the “why” parts than reading docstrings",0
87_clojurians_2019,1546897093,Tammera,"Right, link was actually to clojuredocs ^^. Its hard to pinpoint, I’d admit that, but it feels currently that there is a great detailed explanation but no higher level overview. I am merely pointing out what I recently notices was holding me back a bit in terms of documentation. Please take it as no offense",0

87_clojurians_2019,1546897531,Tammera,"haha ofcourse, and I will certainly not be the last. Its easy saying that “clojure documentation is x”, but “why I think its x”, thats such a different question.",0

34.0_angularjs,1499114754,SargoDarya,Gotta check,0
34.0_angularjs,1499114758,zomg,Rec Room looks like it might be fun tho; it's not too serious looking so it might not matter that VR isn't the best for anything where you have to walk around,0
34.0_angularjs,1499114797,SargoDarya,Holopoint 1.1 hours. But if you watch a gameplay video you'll probably see why.,0
34.0_angularjs,1499114805,zomg,my point exactly; you get a fairly limited amount of hours out of it,0
34.0_angularjs,1499114820,SargoDarya,zomg: That's not the point in this case.,0

34.0_angularjs,1499114921,zomg,yeah I'm not saying they're not fun but they're basically on the level of mobile games; they're fun for a while but the gimmick eventually runs out of steam; at least for me that's not really the kind of games I'm looking for,0
34.0_angularjs,1499114964,SargoDarya,zomg: Most fun I had in VR was definitely Keep talking and nobody explodes.,0

If I have some code like:    setTimeout(() ={ this.foo = ""bar""} , 2000)      and I have {{foo}}  in my html, how does angular know that the page needs rerendering?; I don't get how it can know that I've modified foo.

33_elmlangB_2019,1546486205,Gilda,"Perhaps you want a `Dict` instead of a List, so you can look up the value using it's name, and you'll never have multiple values with the same name",0
34_elmlangB_2019,1546494312,Gladys,"Hmm, I thought to be a pure function you have to pass everything into it as an argument. But in Elm I can define a constant or function and call it from within a function, without feeding it into the function. Is that a bad practice, still pure? Doesn’t it “couple things tightly”?",1
34_elmlangB_2019,1546494370,Bette,You mean by using `let ... in`? Yes you can define constants or functions. I recommend not letting your `let` statements get too large.,0
34_elmlangB_2019,1546494377,Gladys,"```
foo = ""bar""

view : Model -&gt; Html Msg
view model =
    div [] [ text foo ]
```; I did not pass foo into view there",0
34_elmlangB_2019,1546494428,Bette,That's still pure. Think of `foo` as a function in the same module that takes no arguments and returns a string.,0
34_elmlangB_2019,1546494453,Gladys,"I actually started doing that haha, since it also uses the same syntax; I think I read some JS post once saying pure functions must pass all logic they are using into themselves. Something like, if you dont pass jQuery as an argument then it aint pure",0
34_elmlangB_2019,1546494518,Bette,"replace `foo` with

```
helloFoo : String -&gt; String
helloFoo x =
    ""Hello "" ++ x
```

Now is saying `div [] [ text (helloFoo ""John"") ]` still pure?",0
34_elmlangB_2019,1546494556,Andrew,I’ll bet there are ten definitions of “pure” out there.,0
34_elmlangB_2019,1546494563,Gladys,"Well that’s what I’m trying to learn actually <@Bette>, is it?",0
34_elmlangB_2019,1546494615,Bette,"Yes it is. Think of it this way, a function is pure if the same inputs always give the same outputs, and there are no side effects (e.g. database calls, http requests, etc)",0
34_elmlangB_2019,1546494621,Gladys,Id say its pretty inconvinient if I had to pass all and everything into every function I use. seems to only make sense in a mutable language maybe; That does make sense.,0
34_elmlangB_2019,1546494696,Andrew,"What are the properties of pureness that you seek?   If you want pure functional, where a function returns the same result every time you call it with the same arguments and doesn’t mutate any state, Elm always does that.  ",0
34_elmlangB_2019,1546494753,Bette,"So because `foo` in your earlier example is a constant (which is like a zero-argument function, which is a pure function), your `view` function remains pure.",0
34_elmlangB_2019,1546494792,Gladys,"Yeah you folks make a lot of sense. I think the post I once read was saying you must pass all things either misunderstood or did so because it was a mutable language and had to be more defensive in its approach.; Ah; This was contextual slackbot.; Damn, that’s a cool bot tho hehe..",0
34_elmlangB_2019,1546494963,Bette,"There's a term called _referential transparency_, the definition of which I think can build up a conceptual understanding of pureness. From Wikipedia:

&gt;An expression is called referentially transparent if it can be replaced with its corresponding value without changing the program's behavior. This requires that the expression is pure, that is to say the expression value must be the same for the same inputs and its evaluation must have no side effects.",0
34_elmlangB_2019,1546494995,Gladys,Ahh :slightly_smiling_face:,0
34_elmlangB_2019,1546495039,Bette,"So if you can take `div [] [ text foo ]` and replace it with `foo`'s return value, writing `div [] [ text ""bar"" ]`, then you know `foo` is referentially transparent; The same is true for functions that take arguments, `div [] [ text (helloFoo ""John"") ]` -&gt; `div [] [ text ""Hello John"" ]`; In either case, the behavior of the program is the same",0
34_elmlangB_2019,1546495150,Gladys,"Makes sense and I learned a new fancy word, thx :wink:; Pure functional languages seem like they would be simpler to optimize, you know so much more of what is going on..",0
34_elmlangB_2019,1546495238,Adrienne,That is what allows the dead code elimination in 0.19 to work; That and the type system,0
34_elmlangB_2019,1546495275,Bette,"They're easier to refactor as well, you can just look at the type signature and learn a fair bit about the function; e.g. if you are looking for a function that calculates the area of a circle, and see a signature like `String -&gt; String -&gt; String`, you know that probably isn't the function you want",0
34_elmlangB_2019,1546495306,Adrienne,"I would say more than anything though, functional languages and style (and not passing stuff by reference) just leads to a lot fewer ""gotcha"" bugs; Like in Python you can mutate stuff all over the place without even meaning to; In fact, in order to *not* mutate, you have to do copies in your functions",0
34_elmlangB_2019,1546497152,Gladys,"@negx yeah at work I am using Angular and in my code I do JSON.parse( JSON.stringify( … ) ) quite a few places just to be certain I am not mutating something on accident :slightly_smiling_face: … It works a lot better tho, since I started to use a lot more functional code I get less bugs, came back from the holidays and implemented a feature without breaking stuff lol :stuck_out_tongue:",0

39_elmlangB_2019,1546510353,Fredericka,I don’t think it has to do with either of those,0
39_elmlangB_2019,1546510558,Avis,"<@Indira> We make a case for each page:
```
    ( _, SomePage ) -&gt; ( model, Cmd.none)

39_elmlangB_2019,1546510591,Indira,"well, the problem is when you use a union type to store the state of your pages or modals (since only one page should be visible at a time)
then you need to case both the message type and current state, which leads to either redunant nested `case` or the `_` hack",0

39_elmlangB_2019,1546510768,Fredericka,"Well, it depends ; Receiving messages from another page can happen, think async stuff ; The most common thing to do in these cases is to ignore them, hence the `(_, _)` makes sense ",0

40_elmlangB_2019,1546515266,Alton,yeah. and its kept soo simple taht I find it confusing because certain patterns/namings are used over and over again in a different context without explaining the context so it doesn't really make much sense to ppl with no FP backgroud or elm background.,0

40_elmlangB_2019,1546519131,Jenna,"Thanks, then I’ll not try to fix anything just yet. As I said, I don’t think I can drop the debug flag because I still have plenty of Debug.toString and such everywhere; Hey! I have a question about performance. In my application I have undo functionality, and each time i make an edit i push the new state on a list that is the history. The difference between each state is usually small, but the state can be fairly large: 7 int arrays (length~=7), 4 int lists (length~=20), and around 5 plain ints. The update function grinds to a halt after the history size reaches 2k or so. The total debug history if I export is around 150kb.

Is this due to running in debug mode or do I need to rethink how I handle history? I have to many Debug.todo right now to check if optimising solves the issue.",0

if you wanna take a look
<https://github.com/lbighetti/focus-potion>

you're gonna run into a million issues and compilation errors and what not

but if you make a small project like that i think you'll come out of it with a much better understanding; i was horrible when i started learning

i think the guide is good, it's just that Elm takes some time to settle in specially if you've never done any ML-based stuff before

most my backend stuff is in elixir, I also bought elixir / phoenix books
regarding frontend with that, elixir has a templating engine, it works well specially with Phoenix
but you don't have the same quality of the Elm type system there
there is pros and cons i guess, i also do stuff with elixir templating engine on the frontend
i would say you have to consider the trade-offs
I find that works extremely well with sockets and stuff where you have to push things from the server to the frontend
prototyping things real quickly also works well",0

46_elmlangB_2019,1546524340,Fredericka,Because you’d have to case on the type basically ; To inspect the value,0
46_elmlangB_2019,1546524476,Monte,Aye I guess the only reasonable way to ensure you’re using the type correctly (unless you carpet bomb your code with type checks) is through the runtime?,0
46_elmlangB_2019,1546524537,Indira,"<@Fredericka> yes, in that regard it'd be the same as with tagged unions. however, if I want to call a function like `numberToString` with tagged unions I have to do it like `numberToString (Int myInt)` rather than just `numberToString myInt`; you mean like unhandled exceptions in js?; you could capture it in JS and pass it into Elm through a port; like
```
window.addEventListener('error', error =&gt; elmApp.ports.error.send(error.message))

46_elmlangB_2019,1546525304,Monte,"<https://wiki.haskell.org/Generic_number_type>; &gt; A GenericNumber type would also negate the type safety that strongly typed numbers provide, putting the burden back on the programmer to make sure they are using numbers in a type-safe way.

46_elmlangB_2019,1546525640,Indira,"<@Monte> Int/Float was just an example. I think it could be even more useful with your own custom types than just for generic numbers
and in my example the function would still be required to `case` on the type, so it seems like it should still be type safe; better example of the problem I find with tagged unions:
```
type Owner
  = Person Person
  | Company Company

getName : Owner -&gt; String
getName owner =
  case owner of
    Person person -&gt;
      person.firstName ++ "" "" + person.lastName
    Company company -&gt;
      company.name

to use it with a Person I have to write `getName (Person myPerson)` and I easily get into name collisions with all the tags; you mean like semi-untagged?",0

46_elmlangB_2019,1546527042,Indira,"<@Monte> hmm, I haven't been using Either, so instead of defining `type Owner` I could use `Either Person Company -&gt; String`?

46_elmlangB_2019,1546527744,Elvera,"yeah, semi-untagged. Aka it's extensible, doesn't have an explicit tag, it's rather that each variant has a Row Type associated - aka label + Type; IDE support in PS is nice, fallback to JS good. Typesystem is quite advanced though.",0
46_elmlangB_2019,1546528089,Indira,"but couldn't you just stick to the basic stuff if you wanted? and if there's an elm-like runtime, you wouldn't have to deal with complicated effect stuff?",0

Mr.Harold is a well known scientist living on a planet in Alpha Centauri. He came up with a theory that the principle of uncertainity can be reciprocated as follows,

Value Some function tx(di, V) is always greater than the inverse of planks constant where di is collection of diameters of the size of atoms inside a object in space moving with velocity V. tx(di, V) is equal to the sum of all gx(di[i]) functions values modulo V, where di[i] (diameter of ith atom) is a prime integer.

Note: Velocity is always a prime integer.

Note: Diameter of all atoms are given in order of fermi-meters

39_pythondev_2019,1546524767,Stepanie,"Hey guys, I have the following code, If it detects a keyword from the list ""keywords"" It will send a message to slack
If it detects a keyword from BOTH ""keywords"" and ""color_keywords"" then it will send the same message, but with the extra line
``` msg += ""\n*&lt;!here&gt; Colors was possibly detected along with one of our projects*""``` as shown below

I was wondering if it was possible, that when it detected a keyword from BOTH keyword lists instead of just sending an extra line of text like shown above
If it was possible to send another version of ```slack_data``` as shown in ```slack_data = {'attachments': [{'pretext': 'I detected the following word:', 'text': msg, 'color': '#3fce00', 'icon_emoji': ':cat:','as_user': 'false',}]}```
So I would be able to change the color and different options? so maybe if I made a slack_data2 or something

Here is the code

```if any(kw.lower() in comment.body.lower() for kw in keywords):
            found_kws = [kw for kw in keywords if kw.lower() in comment.body.lower()]

            msg = MSG_TEMPLATE.format(
                keyword=found_kws[0],
                permalink=comment.permalink,
                author=comment.author,
                comment_body=comment.body
            )

            if any(kw.lower() in comment.body.lower() for kw in color_keywords):
                msg += ""\n*&lt;!here&gt; Colors was possibly detected along with one of our projects*""

            slack_data = {'attachments': [{'pretext': 'I detected the following word:', 'text': msg, 'color': '#3fce00', 'icon_emoji': ':cat:','as_user': 'false',}]}
            
            

            response = <http://requests.post|requests.post>(
                SLACK_WEBHOOK,
                data=json.dumps(slack_data),
                headers={'Content-Type': 'application/json'}```

I am still quite new to Python and trying to find my way around things, but this really has me stumped!
Any help would be really appreciated!",0
39_pythondev_2019,1546525324,Asha,"If I'm understanding you correctly, I believe the easiest way to accomplish this is to set ```slack_data``` inside the if block, and use an else to cover the case that there is no keyword found from the color_keywords list; That way the conditional would be responsible for setting slack_data, and you could cover both cases",0
39_pythondev_2019,1546526227,Rocio,"and you probably want `temp=40, bol=0`; strings and integers are not the same thing; you also probably want `FarenheitToCelsius` and `CelsiusToFarenheit`, it's better practice.",0
39_pythondev_2019,1546526479,Stepanie,Oh really? it's possible to do it that way?,0
39_pythondev_2019,1546526502,Candi,"do you mean this def TempConv(temp=40,bol=0):",0
39_pythondev_2019,1546526516,Rocio,yes,0
39_pythondev_2019,1546526589,Candi,thank you it worked thank you; sorry stupid me; okay ill keep this in mind Thank you; Also in the terminal window on line 5 none has been  added. Why is it so ?,0
39_pythondev_2019,1546526812,Stepanie,"So for example. the if block is currently ```if any(kw.lower() in comment.body.lower() for kw in keywords):
            found_kws = [kw for kw in keywords if kw.lower() in comment.body.lower()]```
How would I go about putting the slack_data into that?

And then I guess I would be changing ```if any(kw.lower() in comment.body.lower() for kw in color_keywords):
                msg += ""\n*&lt;!here&gt; Colors was possibly detected along with one of our projects*""``` to an else statement? and then make a slack_data2 for it to read from?
I did try changing if to else on that, but got an error (as you would expect) like I said, I am still quite new and trying to figure it all out",0
39_pythondev_2019,1546526812,Candi,my code do not a mention of none,0

39_pythondev_2019,1546526897,Sau,hello guys; I have an EC2 instance runing on ubuntu and the python program with virtualenv; My question is how can I run the python script in the background of the linux with virtualenv? even if I close the terminal; what is the command line on linux that could help me achieve this?,0
39_pythondev_2019,1546527089,Kiera,have you created a virtual environment using the `virtualenv` command?,0
39_pythondev_2019,1546527106,Sau,yes,0
39_pythondev_2019,1546527108,Kiera,okay.,0
39_pythondev_2019,1546527114,Sau,but everytime I need to run the script; I have to activate the virtualenv,0
39_pythondev_2019,1546527135,Ashley,"<@Sau> a virtual env is mostly just a modification to your PATH variable so when you reference python, it looks for the executable in your virtual env's directory first. ",0
39_pythondev_2019,1546527161,Kiera,"you can also run the script by using the `bin/python` program in the virtual environment directory.; if you created a virtual environment called `$HOME/venv`, then you would run `$HOME/venv/bin/python mypythonscript.py`",0
39_pythondev_2019,1546527188,Ashley,"If you reference it directly, you mostly don't need the virtual env",0
39_pythondev_2019,1546527214,Jimmy,referencing the python inside the environment is the same as activating and then executing,0
39_pythondev_2019,1546527274,Alvina,"does Alembic make sense for tables based on ingesting CSV or other files where the output can change without warning? for example, a client adds or removes certain columns to the file",0
39_pythondev_2019,1546527276,Kiera,"alternatively, you can do something like `(. $HOME/venv/bin/activate; python mypythonscript.py)`; if you put it in `()` parentheses, you can then put the entire thing in the backgrouund `(…) &amp;`.",0
39_pythondev_2019,1546527317,Sau,so; what is the $HOME,0
39_pythondev_2019,1546527335,Kiera,but just running directly from the virtual environment's `python` is easier:  `$HOME/venv/bin/python mypythonscript.py &amp;`,0
39_pythondev_2019,1546527347,Sau,Can I do source /venv/bin/python …,0
39_pythondev_2019,1546527361,Ashley,HOME is another environment variable like PATH,0
39_pythondev_2019,1546527372,Kiera,replace `$HOME/venv` with the path to your virtual environment.  That was just an example.,0
39_pythondev_2019,1546527372,Ashley,It just says where your home directory is,0
39_pythondev_2019,1546527388,Sau,ah; I can do pwd to see the path,0
39_pythondev_2019,1546527409,Kiera,"so - if you created the virtual environment in `/tmp/mypython`, you would use `/tmp/mypython/bin/python`.",0
39_pythondev_2019,1546527445,Sau,Yeah so I have the src code being outside of the env package; I think I can do (),0
39_pythondev_2019,1546527464,Kiera,where the source code lives doesn't actually matter.,0
39_pythondev_2019,1546527467,Sau,(. $HOME/venv/bin/activate; python src/mypythonscript.py),0
39_pythondev_2019,1546527491,Kiera,"the virtual environment directory is there to contain the python modules that are installed in that virtual environment, not to contain your source code that is using that python.",0
39_pythondev_2019,1546527516,Ashley,Yep,0
39_pythondev_2019,1546527525,Kiera,so you can use `…/venv/bin/python src/mypythonscript.py` directly no matter where the virtual environment and/or `mypythonscript.py` are.,0
39_pythondev_2019,1546527560,Sau,ah; So I can use the () parantheses to indicate the linux to run background right?; Like (/home/ubuntu/rcs_mwc_receipt_api/env/bin/python src/myphthon.py),0
39_pythondev_2019,1546527686,Kiera,"no, the `()` are to allow you to group commands together into a subshell and run the group of commands in the background.",0
39_pythondev_2019,1546527687,Ashley,The python executable for your virtual env is basically hardcore to look at those directories in that venv's directory,0
39_pythondev_2019,1546527864,Sau,"So i did the following thing; (/home/ubuntu/rcs_mwc_receipt_api/env/bin/python  src/app.py ) &amp;; it is working okay but when it exit the terminal; it is opted out; hmm, I am wondering what I do wrong",0
39_pythondev_2019,1546528053,Clemmie,"You need to use either `nohup` before the command, which tells it to ignore the logout (the `&amp;` just sends it to the background)  Alternatively, and I think better, you can run everything in `tmux`, which gives you a terminal that persists between sessions",0

39_pythondev_2019,1546528215,Sau,ah; Cool Cool; :smile:,0
39_pythondev_2019,1546528231,Rocio,"or better yet, use a systemd service or whatever your supervisor is",0
39_pythondev_2019,1546528251,Kiera,"it also should be possible to do this without `nohup`, since `nohup` will annoyingly create a file `nohup.out` with the output from the script.; you can try this:

39_pythondev_2019,1546528286,Sau,May I ask for the alternative way <@Kiera>?,0
39_pythondev_2019,1546528318,Kiera,"try that, see if it works to continue running the script after the shell exits.",0
39_pythondev_2019,1546528443,Rocio,`nohup ... &gt; /dev/null` works too if you don't want the nohup.out file,0
39_pythondev_2019,1546528513,Kiera,"okay.  that doesn't work for all versions of nohup, but if it works for debian, that's great.",0
39_pythondev_2019,1546528533,Sau,Thank you <@Rocio> and <@Kiera>; it is all fun; so I guess with the java jar build file; I could do the same thing,0

39_pythondev_2019,1546528810,Clemmie,I would still suggest working in tmux - it gets rid of all these issues because the tmux shell itself persists. I haven’t had to use `nohup` or `&amp;` in the 4 years since I started using tmux; oh - is this supposed to be automated a the end? It read like <@Sau> wants to fire it off and leave the session,0
39_pythondev_2019,1546528884,Kiera,yep yep which? :),0

39_pythondev_2019,1546528933,Rocio,"<@Clemmie> the _correct_ solution is to use a supervisor, such as systemd, runit, supervisord, etc",0

I could have a single function that takes in a player id

`playerMoves(int playerId, int coordinate)`

but are there other or better options? I know I could use enums, or turn this into an OO design, *but what would you do?*; I was addressing this problem from a testing point of view, cause I noticed my tests were the same for:

`playerTwoMoves(int coordinate)`
`playerOneMoves(int coordinate)`

78_pythondev_2019,1546776879,Shyla,"*Create an MP3 file from samples?*

Hi all, I'm a total newbie to Python (I'm a JS developer), but I have a specific task I'm trying to achieve with it....
I want to create an MP3/WAV comprising of an audio clip that is repeated at specific time intervals (which are taken from an array of microseconds that I already have). This is for usage as a drummer's click track.

Basically I need to load an MP3/WAV clip, loop through the array of microseconds, set the clip at these times and then output a single MP3 file.

*Is this possible with Python?*

I've looked at several audio libraries such as Librosa but can't find any hints on how I could achieve this!
Thanks!",0
78_pythondev_2019,1546777981,Jettie,Python has something in standard library: <https://docs.python.org/3/library/wave.html>; should be enough to do basic things like composing a stream out of chunks,0

80_pythondev_2019,1546800609,Clint,"UI/UX is the interface between data/functionality and Users, Python, deals mostly with coding logic, data storage, parsing, etc, (hence being called backend language) Python as such has very little if any direct contact with a user. Hence a GUI or another language is used as a way to display the logic, and or data to a user. UI/UX is the methodology of making that GUI or Display language(HTML, CSS, SASS, Javascript, as a few examples) Play nicely with users in a fashion that makes it easier for users to understand with out needing to know what goes into the product. Also with markdown, it is a language similar to HTML and slack uses it to interpret the messages typed into the chat boxes, as such symbols such as  _  etc, have special abilities granted to them through the markdown language so it may not be  UI/UX limitation you are working with so much as a markdown limitation, or lack of enough markdown syntax knowledge; Udemy has some good programing courses, I teach python at a school here in Utah, but it is not a cheap option, there are also a lot of free resources on line, but they tend to be un organized and you have to be careful that you find current resources, as a lot of stuff out there can be out of date and not of much use for current development practices.",0

- there are py UI 'frameworks' that are made with py, and that is all UI/UX so this is categorically inaccurate -- 'hence being called backend language) Python as such has very little if any direct contact with a user'
- &amp; so it is supposely the case that the relevant info imma looking for does not exist in the brains of ppl that do/know &amp; limited to to  'back-end only/mostly'
- maybe what is intended to be said is that py was originally meant/made for only for 'back-end' and has never advanced since, or that ppl's knowledge have not at the same pace as py

'UI/UX limitation you are working with so much as a markdown limitation' -- 'markdown is a UI/UX interface, &amp; thereby it is fundamentally a UI/UX limitation, and this is obvious to 99.9% of ppl/users

80_pythondev_2019,1546803629,Clint,"UI/UX is not the software you are looking at, the software a user looks at is what is known as a Front End coding languages, UI, is the methodology is the process of using front end languages like HTML, Markdown, styling such as CSS, in a way so that a User can Interact with the program that has been written, it does not need to be a great experience but a user needs to be able to push a button and the desired effect happens, UI is setting up that button, Back end languages such as Python and Ruby, C# etc, are what make the Button do something.

UX is a methodology that improves the User Experience,  sure you have a button and it does something, but is it intuitive and was it easy for the user to figure out what to do with a minimal amount of explanation.  You combine the 2 to improve the over all usage of the application be it a web site, web app mobile app etc.

In fact because most of the work that goes in to UI/UX is in User research and design, Often the UI/UX lead does very little if any actual programing. They are very customer facing and need to know the current flows in styles in the market, try and improve UX, etc, Most of my friend who work in UI/UX work directly with a front end engineering team so that they (the front end team) can program out the Design and the UI/UX based on his (the UI/UX engineer) research, The Front End team will work with the Back End team to make sure the functionality is happening as it should. The languages Used in Front end languages will always have some direct correlation to restrictions on what can be done from a UI/UX point of view, but as they improve the options on how to use them Will improve as well.

This is very simplified as there are a lot more moving pieces, but I hope that gives you a better Idea of what is going on.

Good luck in your programing journey",0

I have a MongoDB that contains simple data of bank accounts including historical balances. The data is structured like this:

```_id:""3D2oetdNuZUqQHPJmcMDDHYoqkyNVsFk9r""
balances: 
    0:
    balance: 138661

My goal here is to count how many accounts are increasing their account balance, decreasing  their account balance or neither during a given period, to compute the share between them.

When I run the code below, I get ```{'increasing': 0, 'decreasing': 0, 'idle': 1}

what's the significance of requiring `age` to be defined in record after record
why couldn't age simply be defined as Int w/o marrying it to a record
are there strongly typed PLs that allow stuff like this.
it seems rather silly or redundant to have to keep re-defining `age` across N records as an Int

Looked at <https://github.com/mdgriffith/elm-style-animation>, but it only supports (from what I understand) elements appearing/disappearing from within a div not moving elements across divs.

In effect, I'm trying to achieve animations like <https://media1.tenor.com/images/451f5d8c8b78e1726dd730d7e491d472/tenor.gif>

195_opengl,1499898181,Blackhole,"slime, I am on webgl 1.0 and implementing depth peeling algorithm; but I do have depth component extension; pslayer89, any ideas?; slime, pslayer89 any ideas?",0
195_opengl,1499899621,pslayer89,"Just to be on the same page, are you trying to compare the previous frame's depth to the current frame's depth?",0
195_opengl,1499899681,Blackhole,"pslayer89, are you asking me or not?; pslayer89, I am trying to compare previous pass/frame depth to newer pass/frame depth, but both of these passes could have different objects to be rendered",0
195_opengl,1499899741,pslayer89,"Yes, I was asking you sorry",0
195_opengl,1499899741,Blackhole,"pslayer89, they won't be rendering same objects; I am implementing depth peeling algorithm; for transparency",0
195_opengl,1499899801,pslayer89,"blackhole, gotcha!; blackhole, are you using 2 fbo's for that? One for the previous, and one for current, and then flipping them after every buffer swap?; previous and current frame I mean*",0
195_opengl,1499899921,Blackhole,"pslayer89, I am using same fbo but I first bind color attachment to 1 texture and then bind depth component to 2nd texture, now in next pass I still use sme framebuffer object but I activate texture 2 (depth) and pass it as sampler to shader",0
195_opengl,1499899981,pslayer89,Wouldn't it be easier to maintain 2 fbo's and alternately set each one of them active at the end of every draw cycle?; But it shouldn't matter since you're using separate textures for the previous and the current frame,0
195_opengl,1499900041,Blackhole,yes; it may be more clean though to keep them separate but it doesn't matter since textures are separate \,0
195_opengl,1499900341,pslayer89,"Yes that's correct; I would say try linearizing the buffer, and displaying it on a small quad and see if that works; If that doesn't work, then we can troubleshoot from there",0
195_opengl,1499900461,Blackhole,ok,0
195_opengl,1499900581,pslayer89,"Are you following a specific tutorial for depth peeling? Because you can do dual depth peeling, or front to back depth peeling iirc.",0
195_opengl,1499900641,Blackhole,"pslayer89, I am doing front to back",0
195_opengl,1499901061,pslayer89,Okay,0

200_opengl,1499926501,DarkUranium,"yeah, the last argument is the number of vertices; actually; that too; just noticed it; glDrawArrays ignores the index buffer.",0
