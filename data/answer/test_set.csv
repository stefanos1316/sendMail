227_clojurians_2017,Aldo,"so I have a project, which has :aot :all in the :uberjar profile (in this scenario compiling at runtime was significant, trust me, I measured) but I'd prefer not to have that accidentally interfere with dev if a dev creates an uberjar on their machine. is there any way to either have leiningen delete the .class files after the uberjar is created, or exclude target/classes from the classpath?",0

485_clojurians_2017,Billye,"Anyone know a good way to do synchronous REDIS pub/sub? Basically publish a message, and wait for the message response before moving forward evaluating?",1
485_clojurians_2017,Loretta,"<@Billye>  in a pub/sub model, you publish a message, but you don’t receive any response. Maybe you mean that you’d like to wait until the publish has completed before continuing. I’m not a redis expert by any means ,but I don’t think it’s possible to do this in redis (Kafka, by contrast, allows you to both pass in a callback function and also returns a Future that you can use to determine completion of the publish).  Consider whether you actually need to know when the publish is complete, as one of the main benefits of a pubsub architecture is that the publisher really knows very little about who will consume its messages",2
485_clojurians_2017,Billye,"<@Loretta> Yep I've used the classic pubsub structure, but what I'm describing is a special use case. No worries though I think I figured it out.",0

772_clojurians_2017,Margaret,"that's a leiningen issue, addressed in the master branch but not released, last I heard",0
772_clojurians_2017,Terra,And there are probably still more issues - and least when I tried to workaround this using latest lein RC which doesn't use boot classpath but still fails (I think some dynapath issue),0
772_clojurians_2017,Mia,"Oh, cool; I hadn’t spent the time to look it up. :facepalm:",0
772_clojurians_2017,Aldo,"so I decided to move a couple of type hints based on the comments above from `(defn ^Hint foo [args]` to `(defn foo ^Hint [args]` and now I get eastwood errors like `wrong-tag: Tag: Connection for return type of function on arg vector: [p__8116] should be fully qualified Java class name, or else it may cause exception if used from another namespace`; is that eastwood being silly, or is it a legit problem? why doesn't it apply to how it was before?",0
772_clojurians_2017,Kareen,"it's eastwood warning about an issue that's been fixed in clojure 1.8; so if you're using clojure pre 1.8, eastwood is correct; otherwise ignore it",0
772_clojurians_2017,Aldo,"ah, ok I'll try and disable that check.ta",0
772_clojurians_2017,Jerold,"Is there a way to have a sorted-set using collections (currently just small vectors, but I may change them) as keys? This works: `(sorted-set-by (fn [a b] (&gt; (reduce +' (next a)) (reduce +' (next b)))) [3 1 0] [5 0 1] [7 0 0] [2 1 1])`, but this does not: `(sorted-set-by (fn [a b] (&gt; (reduce +' a) (reduce +' b))) [1 0] 3 [0 1] 5 [0 0] 7 [1 1] 2)`. Am I just not writing the comparator correctly or is this not possible?; I also assume `sorted-map-by` has the same semantics with regards to this. I may need to switch between the two in order to preserve duplicate elements before I apply relational algebra functions from clojure.core/set to handle them.",0
772_clojurians_2017,Aldo,"ugh, well you can't disable that test, which makes eastwood false +ve error on any function tagged that way, making eastwood useless; just going to switch back to the wrong way",0
772_clojurians_2017,Willow,"the wrong way means just decoration for the programmer, right? ie, not performance benefit?",0
772_clojurians_2017,Aldo,*shrug* well it makes the cursive warning go away so I'm guessing it avoids the reflection somehow,0
772_clojurians_2017,Margaret,"<@Jerold> I'd assume the second one breaks because you put things in the set that you can't reduce - collection functions for sorting is fine, as long as all things in the insertions are collections",0
772_clojurians_2017,Jerold,Can you please clarify? Obviously the keys in that case _can_ be reduced.,0
772_clojurians_2017,Margaret,"keys? that's a set; the number 7 is being put in a set, and 7 can't be reduced",0
772_clojurians_2017,Jerold,"Oh, I feel foolish. I've hardly used sets before this. One second...; Actually, wait (I was just going to provide an example where I nest the vectors with the scalars and only reduce the vectors) the documentation does refer to ""keys.""; ""Returns a new sorted set with supplied keys, using the supplied comparator.  Any equal keys are handled as if by repeated uses of conj.""",0
772_clojurians_2017,Delois,"<@Aldo> <@Willow> Annotating the var instead of the arg vector does work correctly, although IIRC it was sort of by accident.",0
772_clojurians_2017,Margaret,right - but in a set they are all keys,0
772_clojurians_2017,Willow,type annotations have got to be one of the most murky things in clojure. thanks for the heads up <@Delois>,0
772_clojurians_2017,Delois,"One disadvantage is that if you have multiple arities, you can’t type hint them independently, but I hope you’re not relying on that anyway :slightly_smiling_face:",0
772_clojurians_2017,Jerold,"Yeah, that language is confusing. I understand it's correct in terms of what keys are in Clojure colls, it's just odd to think of them without corresponding values.; This example makes it pretty clear: ```user=&gt; (set {:one 1 :two 2 :three 3})
#{[:two 2] [:three 3] [:one 1]}```",0
772_clojurians_2017,Aldo,"ha, noope",0
772_clojurians_2017,Margaret,"that's very unclear, as it's using the implicit sequentialization of a hash-map to provide a sequence that is then made a set - the set function and the sorted-set function are not analogs, the analog to sorted-set is hash-set",0
772_clojurians_2017,Jerold,It makes clear to me that sets don't have kv pairs and how they handle them in conversion.; It seems I probably want to use `sorted-map-by` and then convert to a regular set in order to use relational algebra functions.,0
772_clojurians_2017,Delois,"<@Aldo> FWIW I always type hint the var, even though it’s not “correct”, because of the issue about having to fully qualify hints on the arg vector.; I’m on Clojure 1.7 still so it’s a problem for me.",0
772_clojurians_2017,Margaret,but that's not what that example demonstrates at all; maybe I'm looking at this wrong,0
772_clojurians_2017,Kareen,"yes, that is a problem, but since 1.8 fixed it, I would not reccomend type hinting the var. it doesn't work as intended for primitive type hints; so my suggestion is if you're using &gt;=1.8.0, forget that type hinting on the var exists and always hint on the argvec",0
772_clojurians_2017,Jerold,I think we're just referring to different things. I didn't realize converting a map to a set places the k-v pairs in vectors rather than preserving them. That's all.,0
772_clojurians_2017,Delois,"True, but I never use primitive type hints anyway, they’re just too quirky.; But I should add an inspection for that.; Well, the var hinting issue, only allowing 4 params etc",0
772_clojurians_2017,Margaret,"I don't know what ""preserving"" them means - in clojure when a hash-map is treated as a sequence, it is a sequence of key-value pairs, and `set` is a function on sequences",0
772_clojurians_2017,Jerold,"It's that last part: `set` is a function on sequences. I was under the mistaken assumption it worked on associative.; Unfortunately, this seems to kill my idea to use relational algebra functions on just the keys.",0
772_clojurians_2017,Delois,"<@Kareen> Actually I had a question for you about type hinting. I’d like to be able to mark type hints as unused when they’re not required. Is it the case that they’re not required (for local bindings, params etc) unless a) the local is used as the target of an interop call b) the local is used as a param of an interop call and is required to disambiguate overloads, or c) the binding is bound directly to another binding (and thus transfers its hint) and the other binding is used as in a) or b)?; Are there other cases to take into account?",0
772_clojurians_2017,Margaret,"beyond marking unused hints, it would be nice to mention when they can statically be shown as wrong as well",0
772_clojurians_2017,Kareen,<@Delois> yes + also unless the type hint is a primitive one and used in an unboxed context; and return type hints are always potentially useful because they're non-local so unless you can controll *all* the callsites you can't know,0
772_clojurians_2017,Delois,"Right, I’m just thinking about marking them as unused on locals.; I hadn’t thought of the boxing part, thanks - currently I’m not tracking that although it should be straightforward.",0
772_clojurians_2017,Kareen,<@Delois> are you doing this analysis pre macroexpansion?; thinking of the case of inlineable functions that expand to static calls,0
772_clojurians_2017,Delois,<@Kareen> Yes. What are the implications there - that the type hints need to be propagated from the parameters?; Do you mean inlineable or the intrinsics?,0
772_clojurians_2017,Kareen,"no, i mean like
```(defn bc {:inline (fn [x] `(Long/bitCount ~x))} [x] (Long/bitCount x))
(defn foo [^long x] (bc x))
```; that type hint is still useful even if `bc` is a normal funcntion invocation, because of the inline",0
772_clojurians_2017,Delois,Right.; Hmm,0
772_clojurians_2017,Kareen,"(same in the case where `bc` took a primitive long as parameter, this is a bit of an artificial example, but i'm thinking about e.g. the array functions in core)",0
772_clojurians_2017,Delois,"Perhaps I won’t mark it unused if the local is used as a param on an inlineable function, because I can’t really tell in that case.",0
772_clojurians_2017,Jacob,"how do I extend a java type to have interface `clojure.lang.ILookup`? I tried ```(extend VPackSlice
  clojure.lang.ILookup
  {:valAt (fn

            ([this k default] (.get this k default)))})``` but I get `interface clojure.lang.ILookup is not a protocol`",0
772_clojurians_2017,Kareen,yeah seems sensible; same if `bc` were a macro,0
772_clojurians_2017,Delois,"Right, being a macro is more restrictive though.; Hmm; Inline functions aren’t that common, but macros are.; BTW the boxing thing should only affect primitive hints, right? Or can that also be affected by hints like `^Integer`?",0
772_clojurians_2017,Kareen,hmm; can't think of a case with non primitives of the top of my head,0

936_clojurians_2017,Randee,Also: <https://github.com/shriphani/fort-knox>,0
936_clojurians_2017,Donella,but a cache also relies on me inserting cache logic; which will end up being the same as memoize behaviour,0

936_clojurians_2017,Krystina,By tweaking you mean rewriting it I guess? ; It just means you are reinventing the wheel imho,0
936_clojurians_2017,Donella,what wheel?; a db?,0

2. I know about Datomic. I don't think Datomic is the correct answer.

[:delete-in path] ==&gt; returns nil
[:get-in path] ==&gt; returns part of submap

You *could* write a boot task that for example copies files named without `_test` into a `src` dir under `build` with the same structure and ones with `_test` into a `test` dir  under `build` and then make all other boot jobs run from that dir with the structure it expects, but that seems like a lot of work.

1555_clojurians_2018,Willena,Can anyone point me to examples of using `transduce` where `map` is `f` and the `xforms` are the functions called by `map`? I'm thinking of something like `(map #(xf3 (xf2 (xf1 %))) coll)` =&gt; `(transduce (comp xf3 xf3 xf1) map coll)` where `coll` is presumably nested and `transduce` returns it flat.,1
1555_clojurians_2018,Denice,`(map #(xf3 (xf2 (xf1 %))) coll)` becomes `(sequence (map #(xf3 (xf2 (xf1 %)))) coll)` or  `(transduce (map #(xf3 (xf2 (xf1 %)))) into [] coll)`,2
1555_clojurians_2018,Willena,So when I said _like_ it turns out the _like_ is not really an improvement?,0

1555_clojurians_2018,Willena,That was just a passing thought. I think I can probably get there from your example,0
1555_clojurians_2018,Yelena,<@Willena> it may be notable that `cat` is a transducer also; `(comp cat (map xf1) …)` enables xf1/2/3 to be run over an already flat sequence.,0
1555_clojurians_2018,Willena,"Hmm... this may fit into how I just realized <@Denice>'s second, prettier, example probably wouldn't do what I want like the first would; A practical example would neither be minimal nor reproducible so I'm not sure how much it would help in explaining the pattern",0
1555_clojurians_2018,Denice,"<@Yelena> but then if you chain `(comp cat (map xf1) cat (map xf2) cat (map xf3))` you can merge maps and cats into a mapcat; but then it starts to looks a lot like what would have originally been a `for`, no?",0

If I had a whole lot more free time I'd definitely play around with J; Other than Clojure, I primarily use Haskell so before heading down this road I slapped my head and thought ""lenses"" ...which is what Specter is, really.

1555_clojurians_2018,Denice,"<@Willena> so far I can rewrite it like this:

You may be better off with clojurescript for game programming though, and lein-figwheel setup comes with a link to a flappy bird demo that might be of interest to you: <https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel>.",2
2666_clojurians_2018,Ivana,"thanks alot guys! I was a bit hesitant on diving right in because I know just the basics about front-end dev. Would it help to be proficient in JS, HTML, and CSS? I really hate JS... Right now i want to get an idea of how to develop functional applications properly.",0
2666_clojurians_2018,Gabriela,"<@Ivana> you can check out <#C066UV2MV|clojure-gamedev> as well, though it's pretty quiet. I've had fun using play-clj for what it's worth.",2
2666_clojurians_2018,Ivana,"thank you, play-clj seems like a nice way to avoid the browser ^^",0
2666_clojurians_2018,Brittanie,"Thats a no on the js. It wouldn't hurt to know it, but you don't need it, and in the early stages of learning functional programming you are better of sticking to languages that don't let you cheat and use mutable things...; Should qualify that, ""don't make it easy for you to use mutable things"". Clojure(script) does allow it for the situations where it is really necessary.",2
2704_clojurians_2018,Divina,is there a good way to find consumers of a library? Wondering how widespread `org.clojure/data.finger-tree` usage ever got; cljdoc doesn't seem to offer a search by dependency.

2704_clojurians_2018,Ty,yeah (re maintaining) — it's not planned for near future but eventually we might have data in appropriate shapes to answer these kinds of questions,0
2704_clojurians_2018,Divina,":+1:; follow up: does anyone know of writing about meta data anywhere? It seems ""wrong"" to me and a constant source of bugs with macros and such; i've never had to use it so i wanted to see how others have used and and _why_ they chose that over making it explicit",0
2704_clojurians_2018,Leonia,"equality for functions is not something you really have anyway; you have pointer equality, and with-meta has to return a new pointer; for example (identical? (fn []) (fn [])) is false",0
2704_clojurians_2018,Drema,sure - but try it with any named function,0
2704_clojurians_2018,Leonia,"because you are using the name, you are literally getting the same function object; so of course they are identical; same pointer",0
2704_clojurians_2018,Drema,thats what I mean... they are the same object,0
2704_clojurians_2018,Leonia,with-meta never returns the same object,0
2704_clojurians_2018,Drema,then it's a bit of a stretch to say **metadata does not impact equality** no?,0
2704_clojurians_2018,Leonia,it kind of depends,0

```",0
2704_clojurians_2018,Divina,that was acknowledged earlier,0
2704_clojurians_2018,Leonia,functions are not values in clojure in the same sense that the collection data types are,0
2704_clojurians_2018,Lakita,"ah, missed that because there was no monospace font :smile:",0
2704_clojurians_2018,Drema,<@Leonia> I didn't actually expect `(identical? identical? identical?)` to be true...,0
2704_clojurians_2018,Leonia,"why would it not be true?; `(def identical? ...)` creates a var holding some value; references to the `identical?` name then cause the compiler to generate a var deref; like, `(fn [a] (identical? a a))` will always return true",0
2704_clojurians_2018,Drema,"<@Leonia> because In other languages it is not always the case; ```

2704_clojurians_2018,Leonia,that isn't == returning false though; that is haskell refusing to run it; and == is not the same thing as identical? in haskell (not 100% sure about that),0
2704_clojurians_2018,Drema,<@Leonia> I know... I can see that... I *thought* `(identical? identical? identical?)` might throw an error... thats all... nothing more.,0
2704_clojurians_2018,Leonia,"anyway, I think functions supporting IMeta and using reference equality is kind of dumb, but it is what it is",0
2704_clojurians_2018,Drema,but the same is true of `=` in clojure as I showed earlier,0
2704_clojurians_2018,Leonia,true of what?,0
2704_clojurians_2018,Drema,<@Leonia> - don't worry,0
2704_clojurians_2018,Leonia,"clojure.core/= is sometimes value and sometimes reference equality depending on the types of the data being compared; so for the case of functions, clojurec.core/= is the same as clojure.core/identical?",0
2704_clojurians_2018,Ben,"<@Drema> In Clojure, clojure.core/= is far more commonly used, and what is meant by the English word ""equals"" or ""equality"" when referring to Clojure.  clojure.core/identical? is the oddball, and exists really only for the unusual cases where you might care about object identity.",0
2704_clojurians_2018,Drema,<@Ben> - sure thats why I posted with `(= identical? identical)` as well; <@Ben> I only used the `(identical? identical? identical?)` as it amused me,0
2704_clojurians_2018,Ben,"clojure.core/= falls back to clojure.core/identical? behavior in many cases, e.g. the arguments are not immutable values.",0
2704_clojurians_2018,Drema,"I would expect as per docs that the following would be *true*
``` (= (with-meta identical? {}) identical?)
false```",0
2704_clojurians_2018,Ben,Functions are not treated by Clojure as immutable values.  clojure.core/= falls back to clojure.core/identical? when given a function as either arg.,0
2704_clojurians_2018,Leonia,"the point is, implementing pointer equality and IMeta are in conflict",0
2704_clojurians_2018,Ben,"You are probably aware that trying to compare two functions for some notion of ""equal arguments gives same return values"" is an undecidable computational problem.",0
2704_clojurians_2018,Divina,"&gt; As such, metadata does not impact equality (or hash codes).
he's just pointing out a counter example to this claim from the docstring; i think he understands why and the codepath it takes. just pointing out an edgecase in the guarantee from the docstring",0
2704_clojurians_2018,Leonia,"and basically have to be in conflict, you cannot have both behaving consistently",0
2704_clojurians_2018,Ben,"Got it.  Yes, he has a counterexample.  The fact that it is a counterexample, and why it is, makes sense to me from the implementation, and isn't likely to ever change (my guess).  Almost no one cares about the results of comparing two functions for equality.; Personally, I would be very suspicious of any code that was using functions (not symbols, but the actual function values) as hash keys, set elements, or in other ways that relied on clojure.core/= behavior.  I am sure there is some such Clojure code somewhere, but it sounds like an extremely specialized use case that most people would want to avoid.",0
2704_clojurians_2018,Leonia,"so like, the question is, this behavior is inconsistent with the docstring and an implied should someone fix the docstring? and the reason I was discussing the mechanisms and how the behavior arises is, you can come to the conclusion that metadata on functions is bad news by understanding clojure.core/= and with-meta, and come to the same understanding andy has",0
2704_clojurians_2018,Ben,"If we assume for the moment that the implementation isn't going to change to match the documentation mentioned, and changing the documentation is a good idea, the qualification one would need to add to make it correct is pretty small, I think, and would likely only make sense to those with a bit of knowledge of Clojure internals, e.g. ""... except for objects that implement IMeta but are not persistent collections"", or something close to that.",0
2704_clojurians_2018,Leonia,except there is already a whole parallel metadata universe for things with reference equality; not that fns can now ever be changed to use that,0
2704_clojurians_2018,Drema,"reading <https://clojure.org/reference/metadata> the one emphasised sentence in italic is the problem... - metadata does not impact equality (or hash codes) ... the actual doc string is """"Returns an object of the same type and value as obj, with map m as its metadata."" is slightly more open to interpretation -  Same Value.",0
2704_clojurians_2018,Ben,"Starting to get into ""angels dancing on the head of a pin"" territory with my next comment, perhaps, but I wouldn't be surprised if the Clojure core team did not consider functions as being in the category of ""values"".",0
2704_clojurians_2018,Leonia,"and now we have gone full circle around the contradiction. supporting with-meta implies value, reference equality implies not a value",0
2704_clojurians_2018,Alfredia,"well, it works for data",0
2704_clojurians_2018,Drema,an example of using it recently to avoid reflection warnings <https://github.com/beoliver/clj-arangodb/blob/master/src/clojure/clj_arangodb/arangodb/options.clj#L18>,0
2704_clojurians_2018,Alfredia,Wrap a fn in a data structure and then you can compare by value again between equal values (containing fns) with different meta data structures; it may come down to dispatch speed on the fn interface; vs slowing down java's function equality semantics,0
2704_clojurians_2018,Divina,so that is emitting type tags. I get that. I was thinking more of people who actually use meta to stash information and not just for annotation of compiler information; but thanks for sharing that. that's an interesting solution,0
2704_clojurians_2018,Alfredia,"Not really sure, but it seems like fns _could_ be made to allow it. But to your point, allowing dynamic data on functions is about as antithetical to value-oriented-programming as it can get anyway. It's basically a side effecting escape hatch on everything.",0
2704_clojurians_2018,Alexia,"<https://clojure.org/guides/destructuring>; considering this is official clojure documentation, it feels a little wierd to say that `clojure.core/destructure` isn't documented",0

-------------------------
clojure.core/destructure

```",0
2704_clojurians_2018,Ben,"<@Drema> I could easily be missing something, but as far as things that you can call `with-meta` on, they must be of class IObj, or something that derives from them, in the Clojure/JVM implementation.  Mostly those are the persistent collections, but also symbols (which do not have the issue you pointed out -- they ignore metadata when comparing via clojure.core/=), and functions.  Not counting libraries that create implementations of IObj, it seems maybe functions are the only kinds of things built into Clojure that violate the docs you pointed out.; There are more kinds of objects that can have metadata associated with them, e.g. namespaces, agents, atoms, refs, and probably a few other things, but you cannot call `with-meta` on them because they do not inherit from class IObj, only the less specific IMeta interface.  They cannot violate with-meta's doc string, and I think pretty much the only way supported to attach metadata to those things is to do it when creating such an object in the first place, so they can't violate the docs, either, since you can't create two of them that are = to each other.; You may create an issue for the docs if you are really interested in them mentioning the exception, but it seems like a pretty small one IMO.; At least in the past, docs maintained by the Clojure core team tend to avoid that level of detail.",0

3368_clojurians_2018,Carleen,"I’ve been playing with maria.cloud. I was going through some of the lessons from Clojure Brave and True but hit a wall when some code doesn’t work and I find out it’s because it runs ClojureScript instead of Clojure.

3368_clojurians_2018,Rene,I think having a quick guide for the more visually inclined is a good thing for sure,0
3368_clojurians_2018,Teodora,I think the Clojure community defines a beginner differently than something else like Python; in Python it's assumed that you are a semi-sentient ape that has managed to obtain a computer; somehow; and MAYBE can do multiplication,0
3368_clojurians_2018,Julianne,"yeah, it's similar to Racket's ""picture language"" in ""How to Design Programs""",0
3368_clojurians_2018,Rene,"considering how often I resort to the whiteboard and draw boxes with arrows, there's definitely utility in it",0

3368_clojurians_2018,Julianne,"If there's any doubt that Clojure can be a great first language, you need to see Power Turtle <http://timothypratley.github.io/power-turtle/>",0
3368_clojurians_2018,Carleen,This is awesome but it hasn’t erased my doubt yet.,0
3368_clojurians_2018,Loria,"I think it's a good first language because the syntax is small, the core language is small, symbols are first class.",0
3368_clojurians_2018,Rene,"there's a problem in that if you try to explain it up front.  i wait for people to ask ""but what if I want * to be something else?""  in most languages the answer is ""tough luck"".  and people accept it.",0
3368_clojurians_2018,Loria,"additionally the repl approach makes it so much more playful, and experimenting is key to learning new stuff",0
3368_clojurians_2018,Rene,"would a vim-adventures approach work?  a tutorial where you have to unlock functions based on mastery of the previous ones?; I'm not sure that works with a full language or not.  as a way to learn a tool, it works",0
3368_clojurians_2018,Carleen,"Actually, I take that back. I’m sure Clojure can be a great first language but there’s lot of specifics that need to be abstracted or hidden from beginners.

3368_clojurians_2018,Loria,"I think Racket is a great choice too, I don't know if you really need to abstract or hide that much with Clojure though.",0
3368_clojurians_2018,Carleen,"Well, depends where they’re coming from I think. If they have at least tech experience installing Java, Lein, a code editor, and a repl\clojure plugin isn’t a big deal but for an OS X user who doesn’t even have homebrew I see potential for all that to become a pretty steep hill.",0

3368_clojurians_2018,Rene,but i've seen hesitation from our project manager types to even look at a terminal.  they want the web browser or MS Word experience,0
3368_clojurians_2018,Teodora,there is no way to underestimate how low the entry level can go; we're all just used to it,0
3368_clojurians_2018,Rene,"true, but if they're on a computer asking questions we can make some base assumptions",0
3368_clojurians_2018,Teodora,"guitar players are always shocked when people do something like put multiple fingers on one string, because to them that possibility didn't even exist",0
3368_clojurians_2018,Rene,"there's nothing wrong with doing the full IDE route.  I'm wondering if the two approaches are mutually exclusive, or at least not worth the costs in lost functionality",0
3368_clojurians_2018,Carleen,Is a project manager considered a developer?,0
3368_clojurians_2018,Teodora,I don't think the language itself should be changed,0
3368_clojurians_2018,Rene,"nah, but they hang out with 'em every day.  and occassionally want to poke and see if they can do it too",0
3368_clojurians_2018,Teodora,yep every project manager I know is now on a python trip,0
3368_clojurians_2018,Rene,"plus, never underestimate the complexity of creating JIRA workflows and those weird charts.  that's programming, no two ways about it; so, with python, it's ""install this .msi then run python in your cmd"", or do the PMs have a different way of getting their feet wet?; i know my thinking always reverts back to package installs and CLI.  so my questions may seem obvious.  sorry about that",0
3368_clojurians_2018,Carleen,"All good, I share your curiosity",0
3368_clojurians_2018,Rene,"well, the nightcoders editor is absolutely fabulous.  but it will need some tutorial stuff and import functions to give to beginners.; i mean, ""go to this URL, sign in with google, and click this button"" is right up the alley of the PM types",0
3368_clojurians_2018,Julianne,"It's cool because you can do games and music projects, and it leads naturally into his other project LightMod, which gives you some great templates for Reagent, Rum, H2 Database, and a Sente chat app",0
3368_clojurians_2018,Rene,"and the ability to build an internal one will assuage some of the business folk.  that's extremely generous of the devs; i mean, that editor is REALLY good.  it has all the features i spent an hour making work in atom; is it a fully functional closurescript environment?  i see library importing, but curious if it's out of the box fully geared; ahh, that would explain it.  was trying to get it to plug into my f5 ltm :slightly_smiling_face:  simply some code i know; well, there's your full stack.  i can do all my things in it.  not comfy, i need my tools, but simple stuff is completely doable; it would probably be for people who's experience is with apps and browsers and not dev environments; it's easier to convince someone to try something if they're working in a comfortable space; i know nothing of the language, though.  what are the oddities, etc",0
3368_clojurians_2018,Teodora,number precision is really weird (like js); regexes are different; <https://clojurescript.org/about/differences> few other gotchas but those are the ones that tripped me up,0
3368_clojurians_2018,Rene,"huh.  i think i could work within these limitations.  the question is, will it throw off someone first coming to it; the joy of writing type checking code to deal with dynamic typing is why I don't recommend python to new programmers anymore; i mean, let's be clear, you must always check your inputs, etc.  but for someone first dipping their toes in, you don't want to drown them in a checklist of rules; well, that's a whole other discussion, though.  because i have an end-goal of what i want folk to do.",0
3368_clojurians_2018,Christene,Any recommendations for someone picking up Clojure?,0
3368_clojurians_2018,Dudley,"Brave and True, or Living Clojure. <@Christene> ",0
3368_clojurians_2018,Rene,"i picked up lisp way back in the day as my second language after basic.  without the baggage of other languages, i found it quite simple.  years later when i went back to it, it was more difficult since I'd been OO'd into the ground.  I look at clojure as lisp with access to the java standard libs in case of emergency.; I'm a sysadmin.  My use for it is I make a simple little tool to do something like pop a server from rotation.  jar it up, give it to the release engineers.  super duper simple, and all the system needs is the jdk and my .m2 to run it (systems don't have interwebs).  so my use case is different from developers, but if people aree leaning towards the dark side of having root, it's a great tool to build automation for simple sysadminy tasks.; i was almost forced to go functional to isolate the side effects of interacting with the system via the system tools",0
3368_clojurians_2018,Carleen,"Fair point, changing my wording from developers -&gt; professionals.",0
3368_clojurians_2018,Rene,"basic, then elisp, then C, it goes from there.  but I don't have the mindset to be a good developer.  so my mastery is very little in any of them.  but then, i started back in the 90's.  first professional job was migrating C++ to Java systems, with a brief stopover in visual basic when the business bought into NT 4.0's microsoft transaction server.  back before java was considered production ready.  those were bad times.; i'd stand up the servers, libraries, middleware, and then work with the devs to shoehorn it all in",0
3368_clojurians_2018,Carleen,That’s some history :slightly_smiling_face: In which case I’m betting learning Clojure was probably pretty comfortable to get started with given your Java experience. I’m curious how it would go for someone who isn’t acquainted with the tech industry learning Clojure or Racket.,0
3368_clojurians_2018,Rene,"clojure was a great discovery.  ""lisp that runs on the jvm"".  i immediately dropped groovy and ported my scripts.",0
3368_clojurians_2018,Ben,"There is no need to learn Emacs+Cider to use Clojure effectively, I don't think.  Throwing that at a beginner who had not used Emacs before, when also learning Clojure, does seem a bit much.",0
3368_clojurians_2018,Rene,"teaching beginning sysadmins the ""automate all the things"" starts with shell, then they hit the need to backslash x 6 to get that sed to work and I expand into other languages.  pain is a great teacher.  luckily we have intelliJ at work as a standard install.  no need to try and teach emacs",0
3368_clojurians_2018,Carleen,"You’re correct you don’t have to, but that is what The Brave and True book recommends. If you’ve never worked with a code editor before will you be aware of the alternatives? Will working with emacs, even minimally to get through the book feel good or create a lot of friction?",0
3368_clojurians_2018,Rene,"20 years ago you couldn't pry emacs from my cold dead fingers.  but even I couldn't quite get it working properly from the book.  again, different perspective.  i tried, skipped, and went with atom and protorepl, which was 2 hours to install and worked like a champ; 'cause i'm too cheap to buy cursive at home",0

3368_clojurians_2018,Carleen,"I’ve been playing with maria.cloud. I was going through some of the lessons from Clojure Brave and True but hit a wall when some code doesn’t work and I find out it’s because it runs ClojureScript instead of Clojure. Not that it’s a deal breaker, just depends what level of a beginner they are.",0
3368_clojurians_2018,Rene,I think having a quick guide for the more visually inclined is a good thing for sure,0
3368_clojurians_2018,Teodora,I think the Clojure community defines a beginner differently than something else like Python; in Python it's assumed that you are a semi-sentient ape that has managed to obtain a computer; somehow; and MAYBE can do multiplication,0

438_elmlangB_2017,Valencia,"How and when to use them, actually. How do they simplify my life as a developer.",0
438_elmlangB_2017,Jammie,"Tasks come as a consequence of having no side effects in the language; if the language has no sideeffects, then you needs a way to interact with the world and so tasks are how you do that.; Instead of having any arbitrary function fire the missles, you have a function return a description of what it wants to have happen and then the runtime performs that.",2
438_elmlangB_2017,Valencia,As long as I understand you describe commands in general,0
438_elmlangB_2017,Yajaira,plausible deniability if you will,0
438_elmlangB_2017,Jammie,"you are right that at some point it gets dispatched as a command, but a task provides a nice wrapper for chaining different things and support for what to do when things fail",0
438_elmlangB_2017,Valencia,Okay. Let's assume I need to perfom a get request. I have a hammer for that nail: Http.get and all the Decode stuff. When should I use Task in my situation?; So it's a bit like Promises?,0
438_elmlangB_2017,Janetta,"Kinda; With Tasks you can perform 2 get requests in the same command, for example; Where the second depends on the result of the first",0
438_elmlangB_2017,Valencia,"Aha! That's something.; If there is a need for me to check on every request if user's auth token is up to date, I will use Task (check cmd andThen if ok fire second one). Am I right? Or, maybe, you can think of some little programming exercise (like the ones in the official documentation) [for someone like me to do] which can expose Tasks better?",0
438_elmlangB_2017,Janetta,I think that sounds about right yeah; You could try to define a function like `Request a -&gt; (a -&gt; Request b) -&gt; Task Err b`; And partially applying to a check auth request would mean you have a function that always does the check auth for you,0
438_elmlangB_2017,Jammie,"Yeah, if you need to execute two (or more) tasks in a row where the second depends on the first. Then `andThen` is the way to do it",0
438_elmlangB_2017,Valencia,"Well, I think I'm on my way to understand it.
But, can't I just fire my second task in my update function when the first one is executed (I mean, when one defines an Http request he or she also supplies a message, which can fire second command)?",0
438_elmlangB_2017,Jammie,"if you want, yep you can do that; each task is going to go through a message though and so strict sequencing can be difficult",0
438_elmlangB_2017,Valencia,"I meant - why do I need to use Task if I can ""schedule"" everything that is going on with just simple elm-flow (msg -&gt; cmd -&gt; msg -&gt; cmd)?",0
438_elmlangB_2017,Jammie,"so theres two things there, tasks make it easier to handle errors; and the other thing is, you can wind up with race conditions if you are going through message",0
438_elmlangB_2017,Valencia,"1) When I need to schedule some ""events"" I may use Tasks
2) Which allow me to organise chains of ""events""
3) So that I will be able to handle ""events"" in a convenient and proper way
4) And there is no risk of one, second, ""event"" happening before the other one, which should be first by design.",2
438_elmlangB_2017,Jammie,"more or less; best I can say is try using them for things like web requests and see how things compose; Its possible to go overboard and try to do too much in  a task, but they are a nice abstraction when the use case fits; actually come to think of it, I don't think you can use just commands if there is the potential for the command to fail",0

627_elmlangB_2017,Jammie,you called it large enough to split; that can be thousands of lines in an FP language; OO languages keep files to like a couple hundred lines because of state and interactions,0

I’m looking for a common pattern to handle this case:

I have a `programWithFlags` app,  it works well if flags are ok, but I want to exit/stop the app if wrong values are given as flags. (It seems annoying to have a Maybe/Result in my model just for this case).

1310_elmlangB_2017,Eladia,"<@Burma>, thanks, but how can I display an error without first having an initialized model?
since `init` must returns a `(Model, Msg)`",0
1310_elmlangB_2017,Burma,You could wrap your entire model in Result; You could also create your own custom union type,0
1310_elmlangB_2017,Eladia,"Hmmm, I see; Is that common? I mean it seems weird to have this check on every update cycle, no?",0
1310_elmlangB_2017,Burma,"e.g.

```
type Model = InitializationError String | Loading | Page TheRealModel
```; Alternatively, maybe your `Model` has a valid ""empty state"" that _can_ be initialized even if the flags fail?; e.g `type alias Model = { name : String, listOfStringsFromFlags : List String, errors : List String }`; Then you could initialize with an empty list; that may or may not be a valid model in your particular domain though",0

1310_elmlangB_2017,Theola,I'm thinking of completely redoing my model so it's more records and fewer union types. Records are easier to update.,0
1310_elmlangB_2017,Burma,"I don't think you need that `Object` wrapper; You could pass `Editable Animal` everywhere instead; In general, the trick around working with wrapping/unwrapping union types is a `map` function; any time you're doing the following:

2. Do a thing to the inner value

1310_elmlangB_2017,Annika,<@Burma> exactly what I am thinking; But the direct initialization is to come from a string with many values. So I need to parse it first in update or something.,0

1893_elmlangB_2017,Jacob,Hello!; what is the preferred way to work with css?; I'm giving a look to <https://github.com/rtfeldman/elm-css> but I'm not sure if its a good way to handle my css,1
1893_elmlangB_2017,Samara,"`elm-css` is pretty good, if you know your way around CSS; there is also <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/mdgriffith/style-elements/latest> but I haven't used it myself",2
1920_elmlangB_2017,Jona,"I'm looking forward to trying elm out. I've read thru the guide and setup my dev environment. But, I'm sure there is a lot that hasn't ""clicked"" yet. In an order to avoid trying to do things the way I would when using say React, are there any good resources to help nudge me in the right direction of structuring an app? Particularly, my first question is, do I want to jump into having a Store like I would with Redux or is there a different elmish approach?",1
1920_elmlangB_2017,Monroe,"<@Jona> Redux Store == Elm Model. Have a `Model` type, define `init` value (starting state) and `update` function (how the model changes with different Msgs, which are like Redux's Actions).; Basically, I'd say - do things like you would with React + Redux! It's very similar. I think only the side effects will be different in Elm - here you return `(Model, Cmd Msg)` in `update` -- and that's the only place where you can do that -- whereas in Redux you could do side effects anywhere, really",2
1920_elmlangB_2017,Jona,"thanks <@Monroe>, that is helpful. If I am making a single page app, do I want to have a single top-level Model? I'm having trouble understanding how all of the examples I've seen will scale to a multi-view app. Do I have this top level model and then pass the appropriate portions of that model to views or the whole model?",0
1920_elmlangB_2017,Joey,"Redux state is often heavily nested when using `combineReducers` with keys, tho; whereas in Elm that doesn't work out that nicely. I'd say that worrying about scaling is something you may want to circle back to when it becomes important. For now, keep things as simple as humanly possible: one model, one update, one msg type, and see how far you get with that :slightly_smiling_face:",2
1920_elmlangB_2017,Monroe,"Well, you can make sub-`Model`s (with their own `Msg`, `init`, `update`, maybe `view`), but we generally don't do that and try to keep everything as flat as possible.

So yes, we do top-level model and then pass some of that to `view` ... whether
```
viewFoo : Model -&gt; Html Msg
-- used as: viewFoo model
```
or
```
viewFoo : Int -&gt; Int -&gt; String -&gt; String -&gt; Html Msg
-- used as: viewFoo model.count model.size model.name model.email
```
, that's up to your preference (usually ""is this amount of arguments getting uncomfortable?""), there are patterns though -- like using extensible records. Richard Feldman's talk from ElmEurope talks about these your questions! <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoA4Txr4GUs>",2

1987_elmlangB_2017,Joey,"<@Nina> you'll have to explain your use-case a little :slightly_smiling_face:; From my POV - without knowing about your use-case - `update` has access to your model, so it can run that code without needing to first render, then trigger an event, then receive that message, and _then_ execute that code. So I feel like I'm missing something",2
1987_elmlangB_2017,Nina,"Okey, I want to trigger a Http request in a nested view that's only displayed in certain cases and therefore can't I just use the `init` function. Does it make sense?; (Maybe I'm thinking about it wrong)",0
1987_elmlangB_2017,Joey,"Is it possible to check if that request is needed based on your model, and then either return `Cmd.none` or the `requestCommand` from `init`? I mean, the `view` only has the `model`, so it seems like if the view can figure out whether that nested view is required, then so can init; in pseudocode - `init = let model = setItAllUp in ( model, if needsRequest model then requestYourStuff else Cmd.none )`",0
1987_elmlangB_2017,Nina,"Hmm, that might be an idea; Hmm, if the request should be made actually depends on another Cmd, get things from localStorage.; and in `init` I do ""fetch"" from localStorage",0
1987_elmlangB_2017,Joey,"Right, so then you'd move that logic to where you receive things from localStorage - the idea would be the same; your `update` has one job - given a state and a message, produce new state and possible side-effects",0
1987_elmlangB_2017,Nina,"Ah, so in my `update` would I do your pseudocode then?",0
1987_elmlangB_2017,Joey,"seems like this fits that job-description pretty well, doesn't it?",0
1987_elmlangB_2017,Nina,"Sounds about right, yeah",0
1987_elmlangB_2017,Joey,"yeah, essentially.
```
ReceiveThings things -&gt;
  let
    newModel = { model | things = things }
  in
  ( newModel
  , if needsRequest newModel then doRequest else Cmd.none
  )
```; something like that, vaguely; though it's quite likely that you can decide whether you need to request based on `things`, somehow. But the gist is indeed that based on what you have and what you receive, you can decide what to do",0

270_pythondev_2017,Beula,What have you tried <@Fleta> ?,0
270_pythondev_2017,Fleta,"<@Beula> Well, I think to do it like this:

243_pythondev_2019,Mica,what do you mean frontend? Python frameworks are for backend; a frontend framework would be something like Vue or React,2
243_pythondev_2019,Landon,"Hi Jabob, the web application part of the project( what the user will interact with) yes like Vue, but is there a Python framework similar to Vue?",0
243_pythondev_2019,Hiroko,"yeah, but would not advise that; because going from python to js means lots of leaky abstractions and less-than-optimal performance",0
243_pythondev_2019,Landon,"Its not a new project, like mentioned, the backend and API's all is in place, but I want to redo the admin website",0
243_pythondev_2019,Hiroko,"also, consider if you’re trying to do something that transpiler framework doesn’t support; you’re pretty much stuck and have to hack around.; GWT is a similar project for java to webapps, and its… not good",0
243_pythondev_2019,Mica,would that be something like Flask and Jinja?,0
243_pythondev_2019,Landon,so its either starting the whole project from scratch using say Django or use Vue with the current backend and API's?,0

243_pythondev_2019,Clemmie,If you already have a working api there is no reason to add django into the mix. It would just be a _very_ heavy way of serving html/css/js,0

243_pythondev_2019,Clemmie,No. you need javascript.,0
243_pythondev_2019,Landon,"yeah so either go with Vue or .NET etc...ok all, thank you for your advise",0

964_pythondev_2019,Claudine,"for that pattern specifically. `.*\/(.*)`; that would capture everything after the slash; `.*` matches as many of any character it can up until `\/` which is your forward slash, the backslash is just escaping it because it's a special character, then the `(.*)` will match everything else til the end of the string and put it in a capture group; i can toss you a code example if you aren't super familiar with regex; also feel free to pop into my second home <#CC4NKARK6|regex>",2

In Python I used to do `render(request, 'users/list.html, { 'objects': serializers.serialize(User.objects.all()) })` but I was missing URLs and I don't want to generate them in JavaScript. I would like to enhance serialized data with `get_absolute_url` so my serialized object in JavaScript has `user.absolute_url` (string value).

    try:

1365_pythondev_2019,Clemmie,"I think yes, but check the docs; using the argument flags can get you through almost all of the error checking you will need.

1677_pythondev_2019,Frankie,"Good morning everyone. Anybody wanna take a stab at helping me resolve what I think is a circular import problem in a django app? I'll have to share a bunch of code so didn't wanna flood the chat; I think it's just bad the way I've designed it so I'm trying to rearrange things a bit; basically the problem is I have an API which I built as a project app, which supplies all the data for my site and it uses DRF. However, I also have a blog app, which uses wagtail, which also uses DRF. So I had to do some custom permissions magic cause Wagtail was trying to send its API requests through my personal API's custom permissions classes, and now I've got a permissions module in my API app which I need in my `settings.py`, but the permissions module requires some things out of `settings.py` to determine the permissions. Lol; Here is some relevant info if it helps.

My API's *custom_permissions.py:*
```
from rest_framework.permissions import BasePermission
from rest_framework.exceptions import MethodNotAllowed
from django.conf import settings

CURRENT_FREE_TICKERS = settings.CURRENT_FREE_TICKERS
CURRENT_LANDING_PAGE_VALID_TICKERS = settings.CURRENT_LANDING_PAGE_VALID_TICKERS
CURRENT_LANDING_PAGE_VALID_INDICATORS = settings.CURRENT_LANDING_PAGE_VALID_INDICATORS
CURRENT_VALID_REFERERS = settings.CURRENT_VALID_REFERERS

class IsPremium(BasePermission):
    """"""
    API restriction to premium users only.
    """"""
    def has_permission(self, request, view):
        # Do stuff w/ variables from above to determine permissions
```

*settings/base.py:*
```
import os, sys

# For local dev
if os.environ.get('DJANGO_ENV') == 'DEV':
    from . import env_dev as env
else:
    from . import env

BASE_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))))
PROJECT_ROOT = os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)))
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.join(PROJECT_ROOT, 'apps'))

# Env settings
SECRET_KEY = env.SECRET_KEY
DEBUG = env.DEBUG
... other vars
CURRENT_FREE_TICKERS = env.CURRENT_FREE_TICKERS
CURRENT_LANDING_PAGE_VALID_TICKERS = env.CURRENT_LANDING_PAGE_VALID_TICKERS
CURRENT_LANDING_PAGE_VALID_INDICATORS = env.CURRENT_LANDING_PAGE_VALID_INDICATORS
CURRENT_VALID_REFERERS = env.CURRENT_VALID_REFERERS

# Custom permissions for personal API
from lfa_lite.apps.api.permissions.custom_permissions import IsPremium

# ... other settings

# Default DRF stuff for Wagtail to segregate it from my API
REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_RENDERER_CLASSES': (
        'rest_framework.renderers.JSONRenderer',
    ),
    'DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES': (
        'rest_framework.permissions.IsAuthenticated',
    )
}

# For my personal API. Checks both IsAuthenticated as well as custom stuff
LFA_API_SETTINGS = {
    'DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES': (
        IsPremium,
    )
}
```

Snippet of my API's *views.py*:
```
from rest_framework.viewsets import ViewSet
from rest_framework.decorators import action
from django.conf import settings

# Get default perms from settings, so I can change it in only one place if needed, or add more perms
LFA_DEFAULT_PERMS = settings.LFA_API_SETTINGS['DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES']

class SomeViewSet(ViewSet):
    permission_classes = LFA_DEFAULT_PERMS

    @action(methods=['post'], detail=False)
    def some_action(self, request, format=None):
        # Do stuff

    @action(methods=['post'], detail=False)
    def some_other_action(self, request, format=None):
        # Do other stuff

class OtherViewSet(ViewSet):
    permission_classes = LFA_DEFAULT_PERMS

    @action(methods=['post'], detail=False)
    def some_different_action(self, request, format=None):
        # Do different stuff

    @action(methods=['post'], detail=False)
    def some_other_different_action(self, request, format=None):
        # Do other different stuff

# ... lots more ViewSets and APIViews
```

The actual issue is that when I launch it into my staging environment on AWS (elastic beanstalk) the `SECRET_KEY` is coming back as empty, I think because the circular dependency is causing it to fail loading the settings. In staging, I use a staging.py settings file which basically is just `from base import *` and adds a few other variables for AWS and my live database and stuff.; So it turns out if I remove the `IsPremium` import from base.py and the one setting that uses it, and instead import `IsPremium` directly into custom_permissions.py, the app deploys normally but fails data migrations. That's a different problem, but I'm still wondering if anyone can see a way to be able to control the default permissions class in settings.py instead of having to do it in the API views like this:

```
from .permissions.custom_permissions import IsPremium
LFA_DEFAULT_PERMS = (IsPremium,)
```

It would just be nice to have a single place to manage everything where the settings for DRF already live. :man-shrugging:; that doesn't seem like python to me...",0

1708_pythondev_2019,Pasquale,Start by trying to solve some real world problems.  Automate some tasks on your computer.    As for how long it takes - that is very much dependent on the individual.  Since you have no programming experience it will take longer than someone who knows other languages.   A good way to get practical experience is to help answer questions on Stack Overflow or <http://Codementor.io|Codementor.io>.  That experience will make you dig deep and provide some pre-job experience.,2

1414_pythondev_2018,Refugia,"my understanding was if i make a variable global in main function, it would be available to any of the subsequent function . and it would hold any modification done in local function, available to other function as variable scope is global.; yes passing a variable n returning is an option as well",0

1414_pythondev_2018,Refugia,is that python specific to avoid global ? or all other languages recommend to avoid global,0

1414_pythondev_2018,Refugia,ok; when it comes to global variable scope. what am i doing wrong in the mentioned code ?,0
1414_pythondev_2018,Alden,"You just need to define it somewhere in the global scope; before it's used; `global candletime` inside your `main()` means ""this local variable is actually the globally scoped `candletime`"" but there *isnt* a globally scoped `candletime` because you dont have it anywhere outside of your functions.; in otherwords outside of any of your functions simply write `candletime = None` or whatever other init value you want.

```

1414_pythondev_2018,Refugia,"i tried your snippet, i still get error",0
1414_pythondev_2018,Alden,"oh, you need to declare it as a global inside your `loop()` function; because you're using it there, and it doesn't know what it is; Either way, this is exactly why `global` isn't recommended.

It's really easy to do this without global variables though --- just pass them into and out of your function, like this:

```
def loop(candletime):
    for i in range(2):
        candletime = datetime.strptime(candletime,'%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S')

1414_pythondev_2018,Refugia,i tried this and still error. i understand passing a variable is easy option. however the reason i was choosing global is i wont have to return too many elements as each method would be performing multiple calculation and many variable would be updated. and i would need to pass each time and return in each method. global seems easy without passing/returning.,0
1414_pythondev_2018,Alden,"The better way to do it then in that case is to create an object or a dictionary; you can just pass/return the single dictionary, or if it's object oriented, you wont need to pass around anything; (except `self` of course)",0

1048_elmlangG_2017,Samara,"Hi beautiful people, I have a project where the font-end is entirely in Elm, but divided into many different pages, each loading a module.
I am thinking about grouping everything under a single page, which will make the website faster, but I'm concerned about compilation time.

The project has a total of 25,000 lines of Elm altogether, and in some of the bigger modules compilation already takes more than 8 seconds in my machine.
If I group everything as a SPA I'm afraid compilation time may become too long. I am concerned about this time because I constantly compile my code as I write to make sure everything is correct and if it takes too long, my development time will increase too.

Has anyone been through this? Should I stick to small modules or is it worth it bundling everything together? Is there any way I can be smarter about my compiling either to have it compile faster or to not be compiling so much as I code?",1

            |&gt; doStuff
            |&gt; doSomeMoreStuff

Now i have a dropdown with cities. When a city is selected - the coresponding state must also be selected - automatically.

So I plan to have a Maybe returned form withing the dropdown for cityes..

Thiat's why i need something like this :
```
update Msg -&gt; Model -&gt; (Model, List (Cmd Msg), Maybe String )
update msg model = 
    case msg of
        SomeMsg -&gt;
            model
                |&gt; doStuff
                |&gt; doSomeMoreStuff
                =&gt;&gt; [] Nothing
```
I can't get this to work:

```    
infixl 0 =&gt;&gt;            
(=&gt;&gt;) : cmd -&gt; parentStuff -&gt; model -&gt; ( model, cmd, parentStuff )

        |&gt; Debug.log ""this tries to show that =&gt;&gt; is on same level as |&gt; ""

1994_elmlangG_2017,Renee,"<@Porsha> well I think `capture` is really only useful when you need to have access to the rendered DOM element on which you specify the event handler. Since the other option would be to generate IDs and reference those inside a port - I feel it would be a bit nicer to get this reference through an event handler.

My specific use case is that I would like to change stuff inside N child elements on scroll and depending on the elements current scroll position (read: scrollspy) There are options using ports,  web-components and going for a native module. But all those seem to be a bit clunky and/or insecure.",0

2297_elmlangG_2017,Sharron,"Hey all!  I have a feeling I've fallen into an anti-pattern and am hoping someone has some guidance. Say I want to model an arbitrary number of things that will occasionally be updated. What's the best way to represent something like this? Specifically, I have an arbitrary number of input elements whose state is held in a list, e.g. `[ Clean, Dirty Untouched (Valid String), Clean, Clean... ]`.; This feels like an anti-pattern because every time an input is updated you need some bit of derived state (index, uid, etc.) to access it.",1
2297_elmlangG_2017,Trinidad,"that sounds like you've got state in the 'input element' and also part of that input state in a list, why not put the two together; fyi, i think elm-mdl uses this approach of indexing state so the input component can reference it's state from a separate part of the app tree to get an arbitrary number of elements",2
2297_elmlangG_2017,Sharron,"mordrax, not sure I follow. Can you elaborate?",0
2297_elmlangG_2017,Trinidad,"i think i've misunderstood your initial question, you're talking about routing the msg of the specific input back to the list of states; ic ic...",0

2297_elmlangG_2017,Sharron,right right,0
2297_elmlangG_2017,Trinidad,"ahh words on a screen, everyone interprets em differently; so my first reaction would be to tag each item in the list with a id, and then tag the msg with the id; then if it's a small list, you can filter on it to update the item... actually i'd just use a dict at this point",2

2389_elmlangG_2017,Loree,Hi folks! Is there a easy way to know on JS side if someone on Elm side listening for event?; so I have onscroll event and need it only on one lightweight page. and it kills performance on more complex pages; I thought to just use ports to send flag if JS should listen for onscroll or not specially for this page. is there a better solution available?; btw on Elm side I am already subscribing only when this page is active and ignoring events otherwise. but it drops FPS anyway. maybe some message bus overflow,1
2389_elmlangG_2017,Leona,I'm not sure why you would need to go with a JS solution for this. Where and how are you setting an event handler on the onscroll event?; Can you not only have this handler activated only on the one page where it is supposed to be used?,0
2389_elmlangG_2017,Loree,<@Leona> is there a way to set onscroll on `body` via elm only?,0
2389_elmlangG_2017,Lindsey,why do you want a scroll handler on `body`?,0
2389_elmlangG_2017,Loree,there is some kind of parallax-like animation on homepage,0
2389_elmlangG_2017,Leona,"Well, body isn't a node that you really have any access to in Elm, but is your scroll event really forced to be on body? You could have your whole view wrapped into a container that is set to `overflow: auto;` and `height: 100%` in CSS.",2
2389_elmlangG_2017,Loree,yep :smile:,0
2389_elmlangG_2017,Leona,Ohhh,0
2389_elmlangG_2017,Loree,"yeah, I had some container like this, but it causes a lot of problems in safari; so my idea now it to send Bool via ports from homepage when it shown or not and call `addEventListener`/`removeEventListner` on js side",0
2389_elmlangG_2017,Leona,"If you set this scroll handler on the Javascript side, and send the data that comes in through a port to your Elm app, you can chose to only subscribe to it only when you're in that one page you are interested in.",2
2389_elmlangG_2017,Lindsey,Almost every site that tries to use that parallax effect is super janky for me :disappointed:,0
2389_elmlangG_2017,Loree,"<@Leona> yeah, I have such condition already and there is `Sub.none` in case if it's not a home page; &gt; Almost every site that tries to use that parallax effect is super janky for me :disappointed:
it is a business needs; don't like it myself and even more don't like to do it :smile:",0
2389_elmlangG_2017,Porsha,"<@Loree> is it doing anything more than just `window.addEventListener('scroll', app.ports.scroll.send)`? If so, what does it do?",0
2389_elmlangG_2017,Leona,"Well if you setup your subs like that, no update should be triggered in your Elm app when you are not in the homepage, so it shouldn't re-render your view either, but I don't know about toggling the handler on javascript side according to if you're listening to it on the Elm side or not.",0
2389_elmlangG_2017,Loree,"<@Porsha> just ```    window.addEventListener('scroll', () =&gt; {
      this.app.ports.layoutOnScroll.send([window.scrollX, window.scrollY]);
    });```",0
2389_elmlangG_2017,Porsha,"Hm, while update wouldn't trigger, it might still trigger scheduling the port effect manager and adding it to the mailbox; which would end up with quite a bit of churn if nothing is consuming it :thinking_face:",2
2389_elmlangG_2017,Loree,I am just don't know on which steps it's discarded when there is no sub,0
2389_elmlangG_2017,Porsha,"Yeah, I think you'll be better of not sending it at all",0
2389_elmlangG_2017,Loree,"yeah, thats what I thought about and mean by ""message bus overflow""; is there a way to retrieve subscribers on js side?",0
2389_elmlangG_2017,Porsha,"You mean to check if something is using the susbcription on the Elm side? No, that's not exposed - instructing JS to start listening using a port might work better for you",0
2389_elmlangG_2017,Loree,":thumbsup: ok, will do it like this",0
2389_elmlangG_2017,Porsha,"(or using some other mechanism to detect if you're on the page where it matters, like <@Leona> suggested)",0
2389_elmlangG_2017,Loree,on Elm side?,0
2389_elmlangG_2017,Porsha,"Nah, JS. Depends on what sort of setup you have, though - in an SPA that might be a little more complex, for example; In a regular non-spa, you likely already have some mechanism to detect which app to embed",0
2389_elmlangG_2017,Loree,much easier via port so Elm will instruct when to listen it. btw done already. 60fps again on all other pages yay!,0
2389_elmlangG_2017,Porsha,Nice :slightly_smiling_face:,0
2389_elmlangG_2017,Loree,drops only when going to other pages. but there is full re-render so thats fine,0
2498_elmlangG_2017,Odessa,I have started implementing some more complex applications and I quickly ran into the question of a flat state/message architecture vs a hierarchical structure. From everything I’ve read Elm pushes the flat state/message over a hierarchical. Coming from a React background it’s hard for me to imagine what this looks like in a complex application. Does anyone know of any resources for understanding the benefits of a flat architecture and how that looks?,1
2498_elmlangG_2017,Gene,"<@Odessa> in a large complex application you'll eventually need to have a hierarchy, but that's far larger than most beginners expect.",2
2498_elmlangG_2017,Lindsey,You can build hierarchical with a wide-shallow tree rather than a narrow-deep tree,0
2498_elmlangG_2017,Hermelinda,"<@Odessa> My Main.elm for Elm Test Runner is flat in terms of both Message and Model (<https://github.com/mbuscemi/elm-test-runner/blob/master/elm/src/Main.elm> &amp; <https://github.com/mbuscemi/elm-test-runner/blob/master/elm/src/Model.elm>). You can see the update in Main.elm for an example of how complex work can be offloaded to other modules and chained together.; At a high level, the recommendation is about encapsulating and abstracting against use case and problem domain rather than DOM element.",2
2498_elmlangG_2017,Odessa,"Yea, I’m not really building such a large application on my own. I’m trying to add some Elm components into an already existing large React application. So I’m probably running into this question earlier than most beginners. I’m trying to figure out how an elm component would fit together with that existing architecture",0
2498_elmlangG_2017,Lindsey,Note that this all mostly applies to how you nest your `Msg` type. You can structure your `Model` however you want.; Deeply nested records as your `Model` is probably a sign of primitive obsession though,0
2498_elmlangG_2017,Odessa,"But yes, that makes sense the larger it gets it does seem impossible not to have some hierarchy",0
2498_elmlangG_2017,Gene,These would be individual Elm programs,0
2498_elmlangG_2017,Odessa,I haven’t! This looks like a good place to start. Thank you,0
2498_elmlangG_2017,Gene,"Elm doesn't have objects, so 'components' doesn't really make sense",0
2498_elmlangG_2017,Lindsey,You might also be interested in this sample app <https://github.com/rtfeldman/elm-spa-example>,2
2498_elmlangG_2017,Odessa,Yea this is the problem I am running into with nested `Msg` types. Specifically for low level ‘leaf’ `Msg` types where the update logic should be defined. Should the update be defined still at the top level or at the leaf components themselves.,0
2498_elmlangG_2017,Lindsey,"If does use some hierarchy, each page in the SPA handles it's own events; each page itself though is flat",0
2498_elmlangG_2017,Odessa,I will check it out. Thanks for the resource!,0
2498_elmlangG_2017,Lindsey,typically it's done at the leaf level,0
2498_elmlangG_2017,Hermelinda,Let me know if you have any questions.,0
2498_elmlangG_2017,Lindsey,"So you have something like this in your parent update
```
WrapsChildMsg childMsg -&gt; { model | child = Child.update childMsg model.child }
```; For child commands and view pieces you'll need to use `Cmd.map` and `Html.map` to wrap the child message types in parent messages",0
2498_elmlangG_2017,Odessa,yea in the beginning each individual ‘component’ would have to a separate Elm program. Maybe I am getting ahead of myself in asking these questions. I’ll probably have a better understanding of it once I start trying to connect those separate programs into a single running application,0
2498_elmlangG_2017,Lindsey,Note that just because your model has a nested structure doesn't mean you need nested messages; It's fine to break up your top-level update into functions even if they don't have nested message types,0
2498_elmlangG_2017,Odessa,"Ah yes, this is pretty much exactly what I have. I was worried it went against best practice though because of some of the things I read. The `Html.map` description for example says “This should not come in handy too often. Definitely read this before deciding if this is what you want.” :joy:",0
2498_elmlangG_2017,Lindsey,"e.g.
```
SomeMessage -&gt; updateChildProperty model

2603_elmlangG_2017,Gaynell,"yeah, makes sense actually",0

2603_elmlangG_2017,Karyl,"thx; but you would probably end up with some very generic types in order to handle these dynamic inputs and might be pretty verbose to pass stuff around in your app (I’m making wild guesses based on 2 minutes of scratching my head, so might be wrong)",0

1018_elmlangG_2019,Christoper,"My application needs to download a fair amount of JSON data, say 50 MB. This takes a while, so I show a progress message. That part works great! The issue is that there's a noticeable pause at, say, 99% downloaded before Elm draws the result to the screen. I believe it's just that the data is so large, decoding it takes a while. The pause is long enough that some users think the application must have stopped, so I'd like to update the progress message (to, say, ""Rendering"" and a spinner instead of ""Loading"" and a progress bar).
As far as I can tell, the only way to do that is to decode the data on a separate step through the event loop. I have this mostly working by using `Task.map (\_ -&gt; &lt;…do decode…&gt;) Process.Sleep 0` to get a task that is immediately ready, but this feels like a hack, and it also feels like it makes the delay even longer (though I haven't timed it).

When I drop a file from my computer it doesn't put it in the dataTransfer.files FileList.

2533_irc_angularjs,dermot,what's the simplest way to have two different directives in separate parts of the DOM communicate without having them be parents/children or both be children elements of the same controller?,1
2533_irc_angularjs,iksik,dermot services,2
2533_irc_angularjs,dermot,iksik: more specifically I want like a directive for a button that is linked to another directive which represents a pop-out 'drawer' of sorts which will be located elsewhere in the DOM and pop out in response to a button click but don't want to like wrap them in the same parent controller or something,0
2533_irc_angularjs,iksik,"dermot like i said, use one service in both - perfect communication channel",2
2533_irc_angularjs,dermot,"iksik: yeah, I see what you mean. I'll investigate doing so; iksik: would I be able to have the button directive and drawer directive able to selectively inherit the parent controller scope along with ensuring that they are able to communicate via service without clobbering things in the parent scope?",0
2533_irc_angularjs,iksik,dermot if You wont set scope: {} sure... they will inherit from their 'natural' dom parents and still You will be able to use communication with service,0

4383_irc_angularjs,s3shs,The directive link function gets a scope argument. Just do scope.myVar = newValue;,2
4383_irc_angularjs,olivvv,"s3shs:yes, but that makes conflict when there is several directives on the same element",0
4383_irc_angularjs,s3shs,"olivvv, you need to set priorities on those directives. Or start sharing data another way. Your code sounds too scary.",0
4383_irc_angularjs,olivvv,s3shs:scary ?? nowhere I read it was forbidden to have several directive on the same element. The purpose of those directives is compatible.,0
4383_irc_angularjs,s3shs,"olivvv, scary != bad. But it does introduce issues like the one you're having.",0
4383_irc_angularjs,olivvv,"s3shs: yeah, ok, its a really big app that we are building; not my homework",0
4383_irc_angularjs,ppppaul,"olivvv, i make directives that work with each other. also ng-model works out of the box with some input directives, ng-list, ng-change. all on the same tag",0
4383_irc_angularjs,s3shs,"olivvv, I feel your pain. Check the priority thing. And if you have two directives futzing with the bound/model value, you just have to push through it.",0
4383_irc_angularjs,olivvv,"ppppaul: so you require ngModel, instead of using scope ?",0
4383_irc_angularjs,ppppaul,"well, ng-model is special; look up the ng-model controller",0
4383_irc_angularjs,olivvv,s3shs:We try that now,0
4383_irc_angularjs,s3shs,"^ ppppaul ... yes, check the source of ng-model.",0
4383_irc_angularjs,ppppaul,ng-model is supposed to be used when you want your directive to have a more general data binding,0
4383_irc_angularjs,s3shs,"ppppaul, is there some standard way of communicating between directives bound to the same data?",0
4383_irc_angularjs,ppppaul,so other people can use your directive with others on the same ng-model; s3shs directive controllers or ng-model,0
4383_irc_angularjs,s3shs,Mmm,0
4383_irc_angularjs,ppppaul,"all directives on the same tag share scope, and can share a controller",0
4383_irc_angularjs,s3shs,"ppppaul, but if ng-model and my-directive both modify the bound value, who do you arbitrate that?",0
4383_irc_angularjs,olivvv,"but require is the right thing to do or not ? or shall I keep it with scope ? The thing with scope, is that is appears to be more than ""isolated"", instead it seems to be ""exclusive""",0
4383_irc_angularjs,s3shs,I think that's the problem olivvv is having.,0
4383_irc_angularjs,ppppaul,isn't that what the parser and formatter functions are for. also there is priority on directives too,0
4383_irc_angularjs,s3shs,"olivvv, there's an egghead video on how to handle scope in a directive. Everybody says it's best.",0
4383_irc_angularjs,ppppaul,"i tried using priority, didn't work for the $viewChangeListeners",0

4383_irc_angularjs,olivvv,"s3shs:okay we'll look at it (in fact its my collegue's code), but I was really conviced that require was the right thing to do. $modelValue is then working, appart the little damn minor fact that I cant seem to set its value; there is setViewValue; but no setModelValue apparently; okay if my collegue gets some results I ll keep you updated",0

4383_irc_angularjs,ppppaul,only do what?; i think you only get the ngModel controller in directives,0
4383_irc_angularjs,olivvv,"ppppaul:okay in fact it works with $setViewvalue. Since there is no transformation between view and model in this directive, well, both are the same",0
4383_irc_angularjs,Camusensei,ppppaul: okay... so my problem is more complicated than what I thought :/ I'll need to create a directive with a higher priority than the first one which will wait until I get a value for it to do $setViewValue() on the input :(,0
4383_irc_angularjs,olivvv,I think Camusensei wants to use it in a normal controller; mmh I m bad at guessing,0

5247_irc_angularjs,mbishop,"Evening all. I have a ""best practices"" type questions that I hope someone can help me with. I have various services providing data to controllers. They are all kind of inter-linked, where a change in one service's data, should result in one or more other services fetching their data from the server again. Real example: User updates their delivery address in the checkout, and the list of available delivery options/prices update; ...what's the best way to achieve this? Do I inject inject ""DeliveryOptionsService"" and ""AddressesService"" into my ""AddressesController"", and when my ""SetSelectedDelivery()"" method is invoked, then call ""FetchDeliveryOptions()"" on the DeliveryOptionsService? Would that be bad practice?",1
5247_irc_angularjs,bfricka,"Your example is making me sleepy, mbishop. But generally you should try not to have too many dependencies amongst services.; You use your controllers to create that logic; Some context specific stuff is fine. Like something that handles cookies / auth / user prefs. But other than that, handle it in controllers.; If you end up repeating it a lot. Start asking yourself how to boil the stuff down into better service abstractions.; There's no hard rule though.; Just be conscientious.; So you don't go cross-eyed or get circular dependencies; We have plenty of services depending on services. But as you make that happen, you have to start thinking about a sort of ""service hierarchy""",2
5247_irc_angularjs,mbishop,"in my example, i was saying that the controller that sets scope for the list of delivery addresses, has a method for ""setSelectedDelivery()"" which is fired off, each time a suer changes the delivery method.

7990_irc_angularjs,marmoset_,Is there an easy way to detect infinite loops? I'm getting a digest infinite loop error but it's taking a while to track down,1
7990_irc_angularjs,nszceta,"marmoset_ yeah, iterate a variable within your loops and trigger an alert() if it iterates over a million",2
7990_irc_angularjs,marmoset_,"nszceta: that's the thing, i don't think it's a loop - it's because of a $watch or $broadcast/$on somewhere; i'll try logging each $on",0

8037_irc_angularjs,jieryn,"ok, i like this",0
8037_irc_angularjs,wafflejock,jieryn: like I need a service and a controller or a couple of controllers for the employee section of the site; so I put those all in a file together since they share in what they accomplish,0
8037_irc_angularjs,jieryn,"so, when i first start my application, in the js, i have var MyApp myApp = angular.module('MyApp', ['dep1', 'dep2']).config( ... );; yes; how do i wire that into my module tho?",0
8037_irc_angularjs,wafflejock,well the dep1 and dep2 are just modules; so you just add another one there,0
8037_irc_angularjs,jieryn,I already have MyApp.config([$routeProvider]) { } then more MyApp.controllers,0

9426_irc_angularjs,amburger2,"It was the wrong datatype, and JS told me nothing; robdubya: I guess I can ask more specifically",0
9426_irc_angularjs,robdubya,amburger2 welcome to loosely typed languages; amburger2 it would be btter to show some code,0
9426_irc_angularjs,amburger2,"robdubya: Is there a way to check the number and type of parameters in js, or at least report when they are not consistent with the function definition?",0
9426_irc_angularjs,davek,"amburger2, arguments",2
9426_irc_angularjs,robdubya,its generally better just to read the method signature in the docs,2
9426_irc_angularjs,davek,"amburger2: <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions_and_function_scope/arguments"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions_and_function_scope/arguments</a>",2
9426_irc_angularjs,amburger2,"robdubya: This was a problem with a typo, not a problem with memorization of the docs. I just wish there was a tool to report such things.; davek: I'll check that out",0
9426_irc_angularjs,robdubya,"and amburger2 learn to love your debugger; throw a breakpoint in, poke around to your hearts content; its generally a lot easier than writing code to console.log it out :D; i must admit i'm still guily of console.log debugging",0

9426_irc_angularjs,h0bz,"robdubya: its a bit worrying that angularjs doesnt work well with bootsrap-js,, that it all needs to be rewritten for angular,, that means that any new release of bootstra or anything else i as a angular developer need to wait for someone to rewrite it",0
9426_irc_angularjs,davek,Welcome to the brotherhood.,0
9426_irc_angularjs,amburger2,"I've learned to love it, and yet my desire to not need it persists",0
9426_irc_angularjs,robdubya,"amburger2 use dart then; ;-); h0bz i use bootstrap CSS, but none of their directives, for that reason exactly",0
9426_irc_angularjs,h0bz,"what is the ehm,, most popular ui used with angular?",0
9426_irc_angularjs,robdubya,bootstrap,0
9426_irc_angularjs,davek,Bootstrap totally but what is the most popular UI framework period?,0
9426_irc_angularjs,h0bz,"robdubya: i dont understand, what if you want a modal?",0
9426_irc_angularjs,robdubya,i dont; ever,0
9426_irc_angularjs,h0bz,:D,0
9426_irc_angularjs,davek,"Bootstrap is so much bloat in my opinion, I just find Foundation's way of doing things way more expressive and easier to understand.; ~*~*~ Don't use modals. ~*~*~",0
9426_irc_angularjs,kem_,davek are do you use founation + angular?,0
9426_irc_angularjs,davek,"The ultimate solution.; kem_, I am do yes.",0
9426_irc_angularjs,robdubya,"h0bz but if i had the inclination, i'd write my own directive",0
9426_irc_angularjs,kem_,but i want a nifty contact form,0
9426_irc_angularjs,h0bz,"davek:site im working on now has foundation for the admin area, and boostrap for the public area,, i prefer bootstrap..",0
9426_irc_angularjs,davek,"kem_, there are other ways, young grasshopper.",0
9426_irc_angularjs,kem_,teach me your ways master,0
9426_irc_angularjs,robdubya,ui-router + nested views n shit &gt;&gt;&gt;> modals,0
9426_irc_angularjs,h0bz,robdubya: ok,0
9426_irc_angularjs,kem_,i will pluck the pebble from your hand,0
9426_irc_angularjs,robdubya,modals are broken on mobile. always.,0
9426_irc_angularjs,davek,"kem_, you'll want robdubya for that I'm like the drunk guy that hangs out at the monastery a lot",0
9426_irc_angularjs,h0bz,robdubya: you think most angular users use angular-ui/bootstrap?,0
9426_irc_angularjs,robdubya,i would imagine so,0
9426_irc_angularjs,h0bz,"ok, i guess thats what i would do too in the beginning..",0
9426_irc_angularjs,kem_,i didn't know modals where broken on mobile,0
9426_irc_angularjs,h0bz,until i knew better,0
9426_irc_angularjs,kem_,scratch that idea then,0
9426_irc_angularjs,robdubya,"i suck balls at CSS, o i dont even try; i have people for that ish; yes, thats a terrible idea",0
9426_irc_angularjs,davek,The premise of a modal is to present the user with a decision for which there is no resolution without their input. Literally modals were designed for halting problems in applications which required user input.,0
9426_irc_angularjs,nickeddy,"robdubya: yeah i'm thinking about revamping this entire fucking inane modal system, because we're already using ui-router",0
9426_irc_angularjs,davek,Very rarely are they necessary in this modern age.,0
9426_irc_angularjs,kem_,so in lieu of using modals what would be a nifty way to get user contact information; i didn't know that either davek; i was just looking at how foundation does its modals and i thought it would be slick to get a contact form in there,0
9426_irc_angularjs,robdubya,i read an article about exactly what davek just said; lemme see if i can find it,0
9426_irc_angularjs,davek,"kem_, yeah Foundation's modals are done _better_ for sure but the best option is always to avoid using them if possible. FOr instance, can your app continue without presenting the user with a modal dialog?",0
9426_irc_angularjs,kem_,yeah it can,0
9426_irc_angularjs,davek,Or are you requesting their information like to encourage registration?,0
9426_irc_angularjs,monokrome,data-ng-controller='{{ myVariable }}',0
9426_irc_angularjs,kem_,the modal dialog would be a user choice,0
9426_irc_angularjs,monokrome,does not work,0
9426_irc_angularjs,kem_,no just like a contact us form for a business,0
9426_irc_angularjs,monokrome,nor does:,0
9426_irc_angularjs,robdubya,kem_ so send them to a proper contact page,0
9426_irc_angularjs,monokrome,data-ng-controller='myVariable',0
9426_irc_angularjs,davek,"kem_ ah so the user would click on something like ""register' and it would let them simply register in place?",0
9426_irc_angularjs,kem_,yeah!; thats it exactly davek,0
9426_irc_angularjs,davek,Yeah I would second robdubya's comment.,0
9426_irc_angularjs,nickeddy,monokrome: i don't think you can do that,0
9426_irc_angularjs,kem_,hmm thats probably an easier solution for an angular novice such as myself,0
9426_irc_angularjs,monokrome,It seems like {{ controller }} tries to do it; but then throws an error,0
9426_irc_angularjs,kem_,i still need to figure out how to take input from a form,0
9426_irc_angularjs,davek,"kem_, its also the better solution from a UX standpoint. By the time they click register, they're performing another task.",0
9426_irc_angularjs,nickeddy,monokrome: ng-controller directive most likely doesn't let you interpolate :P,0
9426_irc_angularjs,kem_,alright dudes,0
9426_irc_angularjs,monokrome,nickeddy: The docs say that it accepts an expression,0
9426_irc_angularjs,kem_,thank you for calling me off of this modal idea,0
9426_irc_angularjs,davek,Whether or not you send them _BACK_ to the article they were reading after the registration is complete is up to you,0
9426_irc_angularjs,kem_,for sure; i appreciate it; i got a follow up question,0
9426_irc_angularjs,nickeddy,monokrome: hmmm are you passing it via a primitive,0
9426_irc_angularjs,kem_,do you register the controller for the form with your routes in app.js? Or do you just instantiate it in the form tag,0
9426_irc_angularjs,monokrome,It's just: $scope.controller = getSomeController(); Where getSomeController() returns 'my.controller',0
9426_irc_angularjs,davek,I honestly just one controller per route for right now.; I use ui-router.,0
9426_irc_angularjs,kem_,same thats what i'm using/asking,0
9426_irc_angularjs,robdubya,kem_ i always do it at route/ui-route registration,0
9426_irc_angularjs,davek,So I don't now if that affects the answer or anything.,0
9426_irc_angularjs,kem_,okie,0
9426_irc_angularjs,nickeddy,"monokrome: try $scope.controller = { ctrl : getSomeController() } and ng-controller=""controller.ctrl""",0
9426_irc_angularjs,robdubya,vs in the ng-controller tag; makes your views reusable,0
9426_irc_angularjs,davek,^,0
9426_irc_angularjs,kem_,"so; if you do it in the ui-route method, you don't need to use the ng-controller in the view? right?",0
9426_irc_angularjs,robdubya,thats kinda the magic of ui-router - you can arbitrarily connect and controller to any view at any state; *any,0
9426_irc_angularjs,kem_,that is very cool.... and magical,0
9426_irc_angularjs,nickeddy,kem_: ui-router is love. ui-router is life,0
9426_irc_angularjs,kem_,is anyone else in here a veteran?; just out of curiosity; i'm guessin gthe answer is no,0
9426_irc_angularjs,monokrome,nickeddy: same thing,0
9426_irc_angularjs,nickeddy,monokrome: not sure then :(,0
9426_irc_angularjs,robdubya,kem_ i'm a veteran of the framework wars,0
9426_irc_angularjs,kem_,lol,0
9426_irc_angularjs,robdubya,but if you mean .mil - no. there's a few guys who are for sure though,0
9426_irc_angularjs,monokrome,"nickeddy: It parses the expression to the right string, it seems",0
9426_irc_angularjs,Hounddog,kem_: you mean broken bones and such during programming?,0
9426_irc_angularjs,kem_,no i mean the military,0
9426_irc_angularjs,monokrome,"but then angular throws an error, ""Cannot read property '1' of null""",0
9426_irc_angularjs,robdubya,"Hounddog you were, right?",0
9426_irc_angularjs,Hounddog,robdubya: nope,0
9426_irc_angularjs,davek,"kem_, nope but I've worked with combat vets a lot.",0
9426_irc_angularjs,robdubya,maybe its the other dawg,0
9426_irc_angularjs,nickeddy,monokrome: that's a weird one,0
9426_irc_angularjs,Hounddog,i broke my knee before they called upon me,0
9426_irc_angularjs,kem_,i just got out and i miss it i was just wondering if anyone in here had served,0
9426_irc_angularjs,robdubya,kem_ totally unrelated but there was a super interesting post on reddit yesterday about a guy who'd done mdma therapy for his PTSD; kinda blew my mind,0
9426_irc_angularjs,kem_,"yeah MDMA and marijuana work really well for PTSD but it goes against the militaries ""image"" so they VA doesn't pursue it as therapy",0
9426_irc_angularjs,robdubya,"lemme track it down, he got it under an experimental VA thing",0

9426_irc_angularjs,monokrome,"Apparently Angular is doing some regex to make sure that the name of the controller matches /^(\S+)(\s+as\s+(\w+))?$/ before it actually parses the expression; Since it's an expression, {{ and }} break it; :/; Then it is naive enough to check match[1] without making sure that match isn't null; wat",0

9903_irc_angularjs,wafflejock_,"kebo: yeah just saying you might as well learn each of the components instead of just searching for the solution and copying since you won't learn as much... plus figured you must have already looked and didn't find it if your asking here, and I don't know one off hand",0

10085_irc_angularjs,Sengoku,"Hey, what's the best way to dynamically populate the sidebar based on the sub-view",1
10085_irc_angularjs,wafflejock_,Sengoku: you can either use a .value() or a .factory() or a .service() to share your data between controllers regardless of their relationship in the view,2
10085_irc_angularjs,Sengoku,"wafflejock_: That's what I was leaning towards; wafflejock_: Problem is the sidebar is pretty beefy. Like it will have a whole bunch of filters.; Date pickers, and some chosenui dropdowns",0
10085_irc_angularjs,wafflejock_,"Sengoku: well you could package the filters and such that are related to the sidebar into a module for the sake of code cleanliness, but you still just need some way to share the data itself",2
10085_irc_angularjs,Sengoku,wafflejock_: I was going to create a convoluted directive,0
10085_irc_angularjs,wafflejock_,Sengoku: think your better off keeping things broken up in the logical places they fit like $filter and such just use directives when they help you avoid code repitition or you need to do some DOM manipulation that you can't do with existing directives or need finer grained control over those parts or you want to create some sort of DSL in the HTML; Sengoku: if you do everything in a directive the pieces of code you write for doing particular functions like filtering parts may not be exposed in a way you can re-use them easily in other contexts,2
10085_irc_angularjs,narutimateum,wafflejock_: directive runs in the view... how about non repetitive for controller?,0
10085_irc_angularjs,wafflejock_,"narutimateum: usually services; narutimateum: generally if you make your services pretty ""smart"" or robust then you don't need to do as much in the controllers",0
10085_irc_angularjs,narutimateum,hmm,0
10085_irc_angularjs,wafflejock_,"narutimateum: my controllers are usually stuff like grid configs or functions to handle clicks to make calls to the service; narutimateum: if I have some shared function I usually have a ""top level controller"" for stuff like navigation so the functions are ""inherited"" by child scopes",0
10085_irc_angularjs,narutimateum,wut; so controller can be in controller?,0
10085_irc_angularjs,wafflejock_,"narutimateum: well if you have &lt;div ng-controller=""ParentCtrl""&gt;&lt;div ng-controller=""ChildCtrl""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div> then ChildCtrl inherits it's scope from ParentCtrl; assuming you don't use a directive that creates an isolate scope",0

8564_irc_opengl,feelgood,"yeah but if you are reading N frames at a time and N is large its going to kill performance; assuming you want to do anything else; in any case GL_ARB_pixel_buffer_object; would be your friend; hehe; basically you can use double buffering to interleave your FB reads; you basically map and process the video from buffer [N] while you are reading into buffer [N + 1]; and so on; and that way the synchronization point tat glReadPixels places in the GPU command stream doesn't kill you performance wise; PBOs are pretty trivial to use... read through the spec and look at the sample code for dynamic reads contained in the example code section of the spec; they have an example of what I'm talking about here; in their case they actually split up a single frame into multiple regions which are read / mapped / processed in separate calls; Example 3: Asynchronous glReadPixels; is the section I'm referring to; they split up a frame into halfs and read, map and process the halfs separately; double buffering tends to give you the most performance benefit; (as they are doing); although for certain things quad buffering can work as well; no; that just binds a buffer object; the magic happens in the MapData call(s); those calls issue a synchronization point in the GPU command stream and wait for the data to be returned to your client side buffer(s); so if you want the best performance you need to maximize the time you spend processing between the glReadPixels call and the call to MapData; you are using Haskell; ?",0
8564_irc_opengl,darrint_,yeah.; for fun. Don't ask. :-),0
8564_irc_opengl,feelgood,hmm well I'm unsure of how you would deal w/ GL extensions in Haskell; uh yeah.... well you have bigger problems performance wise if you are using Haskell :P,0

9130_irc_opengl,Andon,"dust, if you do it that way, you cannot share display lists.",0
9130_irc_opengl,dust,andon: and how would you share opengl resources between two windows?,0
9130_irc_opengl,Andon,"Sharing between windows uses something called sharing display lists. On X, you pass an existing GLXContext on window creation and in Win32 you call wglShareLists (...);",0
9130_irc_opengl,feelgood,LtJax: you could use PBOs or glCopyTexSubImage2D and glGetTexImage instead of glDrawPixels for writing to the depth buffer since glDrawPixels itself tends to suck for anything larger than 128 x 128 (Nvidia); that is if you have to go that route,0

11346_irc_opengl,geckosen1tor,what is the best way to find the translated offset from the origin of the modelview matrix?; i did glget then set to 0 then load the matrix back :-/; anyone know how to get a vector representing the direction a 4x4 matrix is looking?; anyone know how to get a vector representing the direction a 4x4 matrix is looking?; er excuse me,1
11346_irc_opengl,Madsy,"geckosen1tor: Eh. Your question doesn't make sense.; geckosen1tor: A homogenous matrix just stores rotation and a translation part.; As for OpenGL's modelview matrix that is.; geckosen1tor: Anyway.

11503_irc_opengl,meteors,actually I assumed I'd starty with ortho ans then switch; but you have more experience than I; I guess your technique makes more sense; How can I get the size of the viewport? Is it possible in Qt?,0

11503_irc_opengl,DaedalusX,"yeah but why bother, geckosenator ?; meteors, always render ortho last.",0
11503_irc_opengl,meteors,ok,0

12197_irc_opengl,ville,Just get it drawn. if all you do is draw a box then it doesn't matter how you do i t.,0
12197_irc_opengl,scorp007,"well, thats not all i want, its a first step; later i want to draw more complex models",0
12197_irc_opengl,ville,"you don't want to share the vertices anyway because you likely want each vertex, for each face, have its own normal",0
12197_irc_opengl,scorp007,treu; true*; is that the only way to have multiple normals for 1 vert?,0
12197_irc_opengl,ville,"you can have an array with every vertex only once, but then you provide an index array that referest to some vertex more than once.; s/referest/refers/; indexed vertex arrays",0

12197_irc_opengl,ville,they can be interleaved or you can have a separate array for the normals,0

12197_irc_opengl,ville,It does.,0
12197_irc_opengl,scorp007,and i just use the glVertex function to create a vert from my struct?; so there's no glVertex container?,0

12197_irc_opengl,scorp007,"thats not good, can you suggest a better method that scales well with denser models?",0
12197_irc_opengl,ville,A more practical approach is using vertex arrays for example.,0
12197_irc_opengl,scorp007,but are those vertex arrays static?; or can i substitute them for a linked list for example?,0
12197_irc_opengl,ville,It's nothing more than 1 contiguous block of memory.,0

12197_irc_opengl,ville,"no you can't put a linked list, because it's unlikely one contiguous block of memory; it doesn't mean that.",0
12197_irc_opengl,scorp007,hmm; is the reason to put it into an array purely so they can be indexed ?,0
12197_irc_opengl,ville,new allocates 1 contiguous block...,0
12197_irc_opengl,scorp007,so does malloc...; im using c...,0
12197_irc_opengl,ville,you can also use std::vector as your vertex array.; since it is guaranteed to internally use 1 continuous block of memory; Oh C. sucks to be you then,0

12379_irc_opengl,diederick,"Than when the user presses a button I want to take a photo of the person in fron of the video.

12379_irc_opengl,workmad3,hmm... so essentially a computer digital camera with gallery :),0
12379_irc_opengl,diederick,(is that a bit clear ? (; yes indeed,0
12379_irc_opengl,yip,workmad3: how were those articles?,0
12379_irc_opengl,workmad3,"getting the images to scroll in from the right is probably the most tricky bit when using AR toolkit; yip, they don't seem too bad, they seem like refresher stuff so far though",0
12379_irc_opengl,diederick,are there also some visual effects libraries ? (like those nifty xgl effects? ),0
12379_irc_opengl,workmad3,"probably, but wouldn't bother... I say thats the hardest part because of the simplicity of using AR toolkit ;)",0

12379_irc_opengl,m0`,I am having trouble understanding why we need GLUT; I thought it is just a set of GUI Tools,0
12379_irc_opengl,workmad3,cos its easy while learning,0
12379_irc_opengl,yip,it is. we don't *need* glut; it's just useful,0
12379_irc_opengl,workmad3,"SDL is better, but not quite as easy to use",0
12379_irc_opengl,m0`,okay but what does gluSphere() have to do anything with the interface?,0
12379_irc_opengl,workmad3,"thats glu, not glut",0
12379_irc_opengl,diederick,workmad3: are there ways to create those xgl like effects?,0
12379_irc_opengl,m0`,what is glu?,0
12379_irc_opengl,workmad3,"glu = GL utility library, glut = utility toolkit",0
12379_irc_opengl,m0`,darnit :(; hmm,0
12379_irc_opengl,workmad3,"diederick, yeah, there are ways, but you would probably be better looking up animation effects as they can get rather in depth; there is a glutSphere() as well though for some reason :/",0
12379_irc_opengl,m0`,hmm,0
12379_irc_opengl,diederick,oke thanx,0
12379_irc_opengl,m0`,"void gluSphere(GLUquadricObj *qobj,; What is GLUquadricObj?",0
12379_irc_opengl,workmad3,ah thats why :),0
12379_irc_opengl,m0`,darnit,0
12379_irc_opengl,workmad3,the glu library uses quadrics for spheres and so on,0
12379_irc_opengl,m0`,Cause I am trying to code it in C#,0
12379_irc_opengl,workmad3,quadrics are shapes created from quadratic equations,0
12379_irc_opengl,diederick,"And workmad3 is it also possible to create a 'loader' like they use here: <a href=""http://worthersoriginal.com/viki/#page=shadowmonsters"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://worthersoriginal.com/viki/#page=shadowmonsters</a>",0
12379_irc_opengl,workmad3,I think the glut sphere uses either a subdivision or a hard coded quad strip method to create a sphere,0
12379_irc_opengl,m0`,GLUquadricObj* &lt;-- is that part of OpenGL?,0
12379_irc_opengl,workmad3,"diederick, its possible, and its just a case of knowing file types",0
12379_irc_opengl,diederick,workmad3: what do you mean?,0
12379_irc_opengl,workmad3,"m0`, thats part of glu, which is distributed with opengl; diederick, I am assuming they store the images in files and load them.... not really done much with 2d gallery stuff though so don't know the techniques",0
12379_irc_opengl,m0`,workmad3: is their another way to do gluSphere() without GLU ?,0
12379_irc_opengl,workmad3,you could create your own sphere function,0
12379_irc_opengl,diederick,oke thanx,0
12379_irc_opengl,workmad3,several methods to do it,0
12379_irc_opengl,diederick,yeah?,0
12379_irc_opengl,workmad3,umm... spheres that is :),0
12379_irc_opengl,diederick,oh haha oke; are there some nice/good/usefull libraries of sdl I need to know about?,0

12379_irc_opengl,diederick,"thanx!; i've seen that huge list.; searching for some nice libs; workmad3: still here?; Does anyone knows something about an effect which is done here: <a href=""http://www.gnome.org/~seth/blog-images/monkey-hoot/mpeg4/WobblyWindows.avi"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.gnome.org/~seth/blog-images/monkey-hoot/mpeg4/WobblyWindows.avi</a>",0
12379_irc_opengl,workmad3,"seen it, don't know the algo they use though; ah, vertex shader effects :)",0
12379_irc_opengl,diederick,what?,0
12379_irc_opengl,workmad3,"still getting up to them in Interactive Computer Graphics... also got GPU Gems 2 here, I can have a quick look",0
12379_irc_opengl,diederick,I want to move the photos like an effect which looks like this,0
12379_irc_opengl,workmad3,"hmm... there may be an effects library that helps there, but you may need to code it by hand; luminocity does it through OpenGL and will be using vertex shaders in a programmable pipeline",0
12379_irc_opengl,diederick,hmm really don't understand that sentence (i'm too new into this field),0
12379_irc_opengl,workmad3,thats ok :) you could probably hard code the effect based on a constant movement rather than a variable mouse movement,0
12379_irc_opengl,diederick,oh yeah I just want to automatically 'change' the photos which are shown on the screen; and give them a nice effect,0
12379_irc_opengl,workmad3,"and it would be easier to do with a constant movement as well... would still involve some math to work out where all the pixels are going, and may not look good unless you have some pretty sophisticated image distortion stuff",0
12379_irc_opengl,diederick,oke,0
12379_irc_opengl,workmad3,effects like that are generally done using hardware acceleration cos then you have the image manipulation hard coded for ya (texture mapping onto a surface or similar),0
12379_irc_opengl,diederick,do you know some effect libraries by name?,0
12379_irc_opengl,workmad3,"no, Im sorry :(; I generally stick with opengl stuff.... only a uni student at the mo",0
12379_irc_opengl,diederick,"oke np, thanx anyway",0
12379_irc_opengl,workmad3,sure :),0
12379_irc_opengl,diederick,do you maybe know some good keyword I can use to find such an effect library on google?,0
12379_irc_opengl,workmad3,hmm... image manipulation library perhaps?,0
12379_irc_opengl,diederick,ok,0
12379_irc_opengl,workmad3,"if you just want the scrolling effect, thats easy to do though... wobbling like that is quite a bit harder; scrolling can be done with a screen clear and 2 block transfers in SDL (bitblt function); well, with SDL, make that 3 bitblts",0
12379_irc_opengl,diederick,"workmad3: oke nice.... and an effect like on this page: <a href=""http://rhinocreations.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://rhinocreations.com/</a>; that 'tween' effect; or that ""boing"" effect",0
12379_irc_opengl,workmad3,"can't read it to navigate :/; tweening is generally just linear interpolation with keyframes.. basically you set up where you want something to be at certain times, and then use liner interpolation to move it in as traight line to there and fill in between (tween) the sections",0
12379_irc_opengl,diederick,yeah indeed,0
12379_irc_opengl,workmad3,*a straight,0
12379_irc_opengl,diederick,"Aint it possible to 'use' some sort of library which just creates the effect for me, where they 'tween/scroll' a plane/surface ?",0
12379_irc_opengl,workmad3,"probably, but don't know the names of any, I'm afraid :(",0
12379_irc_opengl,prophile,diederick: use Core Graphics :P,0
12379_irc_opengl,workmad3,scrolling 2 screens isn't hard though,0
12379_irc_opengl,diederick,workmad3: I'm seearching for it but cant' find it,0
12379_irc_opengl,workmad3,basic idea is that you set up the 2 images in their own surfaces. One is being shown at present and the other is ready to move,0
12379_irc_opengl,diederick,yes indeed,0
12379_irc_opengl,workmad3,"then update the first one so its moveing off one side of the screen, and the other so its moving onto the opposite",0
12379_irc_opengl,diederick,and that using the Core Graphics ?,0
12379_irc_opengl,workmad3,thats just using standard SDL,0
12379_irc_opengl,diederick,"oh oke, didn't knew that; workmad3: can jou join #diederick ?",0
12379_irc_opengl,feelgood,diederick what are you trying to do here?; video processing wise...,0
12379_irc_opengl,diederick,I want to capture a frame and write it back to an image file.. than use that image in a sort image-strip slideshow,0
12379_irc_opengl,feelgood,ah shit that is easy :D,0
12379_irc_opengl,diederick,(and I want to have some alpha-transparency overlays over the movie),0
12379_irc_opengl,workmad3,its the scrolling effects that arent so ;) although a simple scroller is,0
12379_irc_opengl,feelgood,well what OS are you targeting for this?; Mac OS X I assume?,0
12379_irc_opengl,diederick,windows,0
12379_irc_opengl,feelgood,ah alright,0
12379_irc_opengl,diederick,feelgood: do you know if there are some libraries which can help me to create 'tween' effects; for the scrolling of the photos,0
12379_irc_opengl,feelgood,well something like DirectShow might have something; but that isn't going to be useful GL wise,0
12379_irc_opengl,diederick,"haha indeed; ... I saw a nice library ""console"" or something for SDL, which creates a Quake like console.. do you know such a thing for opengl; feelgood: ?",0
12379_irc_opengl,feelgood,well considering that SDL is layered on top of OpenGL...,0
12379_irc_opengl,diederick,oh oke,0
12379_irc_opengl,feelgood,"although there are several accelerated text rendering APIs available (using OpenGL) which you could use for this sort of thing; correct although only one of which has anything to do w/ OpenGL; yeah although certain ""consoles"" (i.e. the one in Mac OS X might be a good example) sort of bastardize that since they allow some level of scriptability w/o ever needing to invoke a shell at all; half-assed / crappy scriptability though :P",0
12379_irc_opengl,Plagman,"feelgood: I thought the Max OSX console invoked a shell; It comes with a dialog that asks which shell you want to run, doesn't it ?",0
12379_irc_opengl,prophile,Plagman: the Mac OS X console is just a logfile viewer...,0
12379_irc_opengl,feelgood,mmm well Console.app gives you the system console (namely access to console.log and system.log + a few other things),0
12379_irc_opengl,prophile,indeed; or do you mean Terminal?,0
12379_irc_opengl,Plagman,"Oh, yeah.; I meant terminal; sorry",0

12379_irc_opengl,Plagman,these colours don't run :o,0

13059_irc_opengl,Eulex,nowadays it's faster to draw 2d using 3d acceleration than to draw 2d using 2d acceleration,0

15845_irc_opengl,Maddas,"Hi. I found out why I had the strange problems with my fragment shaders previously: If there is any (not obviously unreachable) loop (do..while, while, for) in my program, the compiler pretty much messes up my program (without giving any error messages).; Is there any easy way to ensure that dynamic branching/looping should be possible on my video card using GLSL? I use OS X, and Apple's OpenGL Shader Builder program runs shaders with loops just fine, so I'm not sure why it would break when loading them manually.; Hm, looks like the X800 doesn't support dynamic branching in hardware. Perhaps the Shader Builder emulated the shaders.",1
15845_irc_opengl,virus,"Maddas, I once read in the GLSL specs that loops are ment to result in non-deterministic behavior. The only loops supported in shaders are those that can be unrolled. I'm no shader expert (yet?) and only know some very basics.",0
15845_irc_opengl,_feelgood,"virus: you can in fact have ""true"" loops and branches in a shader (i.e. ones which aren't necessarily unrolled at compiler time); err loops and conditionals I should say; right now on anything less than SM 4.0 series hardware (i.e. Nvidia's G80 series) you can't have a fragment shader w/ a condition variable (limit) only known at run-time though; at least on certain GPUs; Maddas you can post the shader code and I can tell you where (and why) you are having problems here",2
15845_irc_opengl,Maddas,"_fI don't use Apple's Shader Builder for this. I only used it to test a simple program that failed if I compiled it 'manually'.

But that general loops aren't supported (on my hardware, at least) explains the problem.; (Oops, there's a missing "";}"" at the end of that shader); I assumed that Shader Builder wouldn't use software emulation unless I told it to, but if it does, that explains why it worked there.",0
15845_irc_opengl,feelgood,"huh? it *has* to use the SW fallback if the shader isn't capable of running in hardware and btw this ""fact"" has nothing to do w/ the shader editing tool being used; this is a GLSL requirement; and as I stated earlier using the ""return"" keyword is very much a problem point on older (hell even SM 3.0 series hardware) GPUs; furthermore your usage of a uniform variable as the condition variable in that ""for"" loop is what throws your program off of the hardware path on that GPU; loop(s) which cannot be unrolled (or the iteration count isn't fixed *or* known at compile time) are *not* possible on this card; this subject was discussed at length in the mac-opengl MLs on lists.apple.com a few weeks back",0

591_irc_c++-general,veverak,PSvils: if you do not manually initialize that std::Vector or do it in any other way; PSvils: the contents of the std::vector is the content of the array at initialization of main structure; PSvils: (when you typecast it in the access function),0

591_irc_c++-general,PSvils,"future consideration point makes sense, ye; but in this case it would be about plugins - the central storage would hold data, dlls loaded in and out shouldn't necessarily take their data with them.; for example, multiple plugins using the same component.",0
591_irc_c++-general,veverak,inheritance it is then,0
591_irc_c++-general,PSvils,"mmm, I do not comprehendo",0
591_irc_c++-general,veverak,"I mean, this is hard to decide withou having the overview over entire thing; but one of the ways to handle plugins is inheritance; you have central storage with vector&lt;Interface> and each plugin inserts into that vector it's custom class that inherist from interface",0

591_irc_c++-general,veverak,wat; yeah you are storing pointers; and you are a good coder and you took care properly of virtual destructors; and you won't unload the library unless that destructor is called,0

What if I have resources that I don't want that forked child to mess with?; What is a better way to run an external process from within my program, without fork-ing something that is too delicate to just let it run for a few milliseconds after being duplicated, or even to just shoot down afterwards :/; So what is the solution?",1

2365_irc_c++-general,dunpeal,It's like trying to dance in a body cast. Everything is closed by default and unhackable.; blackandblue: is this for desktop or laptop?,0
2365_irc_c++-general,rpav,kinda .. you can actaully hook into some stuff and MS has a number of APIs for things .. they just seem poor by comparison,0
2365_irc_c++-general,blackandblue,"Aleric, what desktop environment?",0
2365_irc_c++-general,fooobarrr,i don't like taking all day reading MS apis,0
2365_irc_c++-general,blackandblue,"dunpeal, laptop but connected to 24 inch monitor and mouse + keyboard",0
2365_irc_c++-general,rpav,he said KDE,0
2365_irc_c++-general,blackandblue,oh ok. sorry didnt read,0
2365_irc_c++-general,dunpeal,"rpav: sure, there's a few hooks and APIs, except they're generally purely documented, and limited compared to what you can do with Linux",0
2365_irc_c++-general,blackandblue,so kubuntu 18.04? Aleric,0
2365_irc_c++-general,rpav,dunpeal: that seems to be the case,0
2365_irc_c++-general,Aleric,blackandblue: plasma - when you just install ubuntu it might look HORRIBLE - you have to get the right configuration :p,0

2365_irc_c++-general,dunpeal,blackandblue: 18.04 default should work pretty well. you can get a taste by running a live session from USB.,0
2365_irc_c++-general,blackandblue,you install plasma packagge on top of it?,0
2365_irc_c++-general,dunpeal,"If you're going to use KDE, get Kubuntu.",0
2365_irc_c++-general,rpav,"arch is ""well you use stricly our package set and probably it's fine,"" but it's far from acceptable, and as soon as you hit AUR all bets are off .. and your need AUR for anything useful",0
2365_irc_c++-general,Aleric,you can get kubuntu,0
2365_irc_c++-general,blackandblue,the random ubuntu errors are what I am worried about,0
2365_irc_c++-general,fooobarrr,i don't know what these errors are,0
2365_irc_c++-general,Aleric,"sorry I forgot to add the k - I use kde, so I guess I use kubuntu.",0
2365_irc_c++-general,blackandblue,"rpav, true; rpav, so you have tried arch and ubuntu both right",0
2365_irc_c++-general,rpav,"blackandblue: if you have errors, look them up or ask ubuntu people .. i haven't seen any such thing",0
2365_irc_c++-general,dunpeal,"blackandblue: the only real issue is hardware support, and that's getting better with every release.",0
2365_irc_c++-general,blackandblue,chromium stops responding etc.,0
2365_irc_c++-general,fooobarrr,i don't run into errors until I start doing weird things,0
2365_irc_c++-general,rpav,"i have tried almost everything at some point; i miss gentoo, but i don't have the time to build everything anymore",0
2365_irc_c++-general,dunpeal,what do you miss about gentoo,0
2365_irc_c++-general,blackandblue,"rpav, so you prefer ubuntu over arch?",0
2365_irc_c++-general,rpav,"building everything with whatever options i want .. and the toolset, man",0
2365_irc_c++-general,Aleric,"blackandblue: Yes, that is an annoying problem :/. I solved that by turning off desktop emulation stuff.",0
2365_irc_c++-general,dunpeal,blackandblue: you should not try arch if this is your first Linux,0
2365_irc_c++-general,rpav,blackandblue: basically,0
2365_irc_c++-general,blackandblue,"dunpeal, not my first linux",0
2365_irc_c++-general,Aleric,I mean... what's it called and your window can wobble n stuff,0
2365_irc_c++-general,hellozee,"rpav, doesn't portage takes care of all that stuff?",0
2365_irc_c++-general,dunpeal,"blackandblue: based on what you wrote here, still.",0
2365_irc_c++-general,rpav,hellozee: ?,0
2365_irc_c++-general,blackandblue,I have used many distros in past thats why I am telling you about the specific errors ubuntu has,0
2365_irc_c++-general,hellozee,"rpav, that compiling part",0
2365_irc_c++-general,dunpeal,"if you fear stablity issues, arch will not be your best bet.",0
2365_irc_c++-general,blackandblue,"Aleric, that fixes the error?",0
2365_irc_c++-general,Aleric,yup - it did for me. Completely.,0
2365_irc_c++-general,rpav,"hellozee: right the point is the time it takes, and i have a reasonable system. i liked it, but at some point if i want something i don't want to take an hour to wait for it to install",0
2365_irc_c++-general,blackandblue,"Aleric, kindly let me know the name plz",0
2365_irc_c++-general,Aleric,compaz I think it's called.,0
2365_irc_c++-general,blackandblue,"Aleric, I see. composite manager; so if I stop it, I will get screen tearing",0
2365_irc_c++-general,dunpeal,"rpav: I still build the tools I used most myself, e.g. screen and vim",0
2365_irc_c++-general,rpav,"hellozee: but man the tools gentoo has .. other dists vs gentoo are like, windows vs linux dev ;)",0
2365_irc_c++-general,dunpeal,On Ubuntu,0
2365_irc_c++-general,Aleric,"but you can configure it somewhere, and just uncheck all the weird boxes (like wobbling windows etc).",0
2365_irc_c++-general,hellozee,"rpav, most things won't take an hour after the initial setup",0
2365_irc_c++-general,rpav,dunpeal: i build a few things like cmake .. i try to get other stuff where i can,0
2365_irc_c++-general,hellozee,"rpav, I mostly install binaries if I think that package will take an hour to compile",0
2365_irc_c++-general,dunpeal,"Sure, I mostly rely on binaries. My point is that with Ubuntu, I can get binaries for everything, then the few specific tools I use most - I can build and customize to my heart's delight.",0
2365_irc_c++-general,rpav,"i superbuild direct dev deps, because i don't want to rely on whatever random halfassed build options they used for the dist .. and clang, because no one ever builds that correctly or keeps it up to date",0
2365_irc_c++-general,dunpeal,"So it's like the best of both worlds, and I don't see why Gentoo would be better for me.",0
2365_irc_c++-general,rpav,dunpeal: pretty much,0
2365_irc_c++-general,blackandblue,"Aleric, did you try arch before?; rpav, if I am not gaming, should I remove windows 10 completely or its still required somewhere?",0
2365_irc_c++-general,Aleric,no - I used debian before this - and before that.. I can't really remember :p Slackware? Also redhat I think.,0
2365_irc_c++-general,rpav,"dunpeal: i actually wish there was a gentoo binary dist .. there's that one iffy hybrid but i had issues with it .. but like, binary packages by default or just build from portage with options if i want .. should totally work in their system; just no one does it; blackandblue: do you need it? i find it extremely helpful to build from time to time in MSVC; clang/gcc are *rather* closely related .. msvc is not, and thus you tend to ferret out errors that otherwise might go unnoticed",0
2365_irc_c++-general,dunpeal,"rpav: even if there was, Ubuntu would still have a far larger binary catalog + better hardware support + some unique packages as a major distro.",0
2365_irc_c++-general,rpav,also retain compatibility,0
2365_irc_c++-general,Aleric,"If you are a developer and want to test cross platform stuff then you'll need windows (in a VM?). I never used windows, so I don't miss it either :p",0
2365_irc_c++-general,rpav,"dunpeal: i'm not arguing for gentoo, i'm just saying its distro tools were awesome, and the transparency .. win:lin :: other:gentoo is a reasonable analogy .. but at the end of the day, tools are less useful than ""just install this shit k""",0
2365_irc_c++-general,dunpeal,"blackandblue: if you don't develop for Windows, I strongly recommend removing Windows completely and installing Ubuntu as a single OS.; rpav: I don't think the transparency gap between gento and other Linux systems is anywhere near as between Windows and Linux :)",0
2365_irc_c++-general,blackandblue,yea I am also thinking about that; however I am afraid I will lose Visual studio IDE,0
2365_irc_c++-general,dunpeal,"there's other transparent distros, e.g. Slack; blackandblue: if you want to develop in Linux, then develop in Linux.",0
2365_irc_c++-general,blackandblue,in ubuntu I have to add ppa's. in arch they are just command line away.. dont you guys think so,0
2365_irc_c++-general,dunpeal,"blackandblue: no, you will only have to add ppa's for packages that are not in the main repos.; Almost everything is in the main repos.; Most packages that will require a PPA in Ubuntu don't even exist for Arch.",0
2365_irc_c++-general,rpav,"eh .. git, cmake, and some stuff are not very up to date in main, or fall behind easily",0
2365_irc_c++-general,Aleric,"I don't think there are tutorials on the net that explain how to set up a developers PC on linux? I mean, I have a whole system existing of many components - but if you're new to linux then I can imagine you're never going to figure that out on your own.",0

2365_irc_c++-general,rpav,the only reason i'm not using ubuntu proper on here is because i have mdadm raid-10 / and ubuntu didn't have the drivers for their desktop release in 16.04 or something; otherwise it's super point and shoot,0
2365_irc_c++-general,blackandblue,"dunpeal, you do get bug fixes in arch quicker",0
2365_irc_c++-general,Aleric,"For a start - use a truecolor terminal (which?) install neovim - plus a dozen plugins and scripts (takes lots of time to find them all) so you can use ctags and jump around you code easily, with nice syntax highlighting.

2365_irc_c++-general,blackandblue,heard nvim is improved vim. how true is that?,0
2365_irc_c++-general,Aleric,dunpeal: mostly based on my usage of libcwd. But the a few times that I actually need to step through the code I use gdb (I seldom do that though - it is just not feasible with complex multithreaded programs); s/the a/the/,0
2365_irc_c++-general,dunpeal,"Aleric: do you use a front end for gdb, or just the naked CLI UI?",0

3103_irc_c++-general,s_frit,does anyone know a clean portable way to pad struct members for cache line alignment (say 64-byte or 128-byte alignment)? seems like alignas would be perfect if it portably supported overaligned types,1
3103_irc_c++-general,cbreak,s_frit: what do you want to align?; you want to prevent members from being cached?,2
3103_irc_c++-general,s_frit,"cbreak: i want to ensure two different sets of members are not on the same cache line to avoid false sharing. one cache-line should be read-only on all cores, and the other is used for communication (it's a hot list head that's manipulated with atomics); cbreak: i can manually pad with dummy members (that's what i'm doing at the moment) just asking if there's a better way",0
3103_irc_c++-general,cbreak,I think that cache-line sized alignment requirements are very non-required,0
3103_irc_c++-general,s_frit,in what sense?,0
3103_irc_c++-general,cbreak,they don't have to be supported,0
3103_irc_c++-general,s_frit,that's my understanding yes. it's implementation defined whether alignment greater than alignof(std::max_align_t); is supported; { std::cout &lt;&lt; alignof(std::max_align_t); },0
3103_irc_c++-general,cbreak,what's the cache line size of your architecture?,0
3103_irc_c++-general,s_frit,"64; but apparently there is some false-sharing penalty for pairs. so i'd probably go with 128; there's only going to be one of these structures in the whole system; given how important it is, probably the best thing is to just pad the struct then put some runtime checks in the ctor; *manually pad the struct; i was thinking i could maybe use unions with 128-byte arrays in them",0
3103_irc_c++-general,cbreak,that wouldn't make your whole thing be 128 byte aligned,0
3103_irc_c++-general,s_frit,true. making the whole thing aligned is a separate problem if i cant use alignas(128); currently i'm asking about aligning the two sets of fields within the class,0

5054_irc_c++-general,InPhase,kalven: Inside of C++ it's hard to treat adjacent bools as 32-bit integers without hitting some sort of violation. But the compiler should be allowed to do that to optimize.,0
5054_irc_c++-general,kalven,"it's not doing that in this case; InPhase: oh, I see what you're saying.. yes, it could do that.",0
5054_irc_c++-general,ViralTaco,No it's just checking every bool to see if it's 0; if it is it jumps otherwise it keeps going on,0
5054_irc_c++-general,kalven,ViralTaco: we know what the semantics are,0
5054_irc_c++-general,ViralTaco,are you wondering if xor'ing 2 ints would be faster?; Because if anything it'd be slower since 32> 20; afaik,0
5054_irc_c++-general,kalven,"ViralTaco: no, I'm saying that it wastes effort. say that the 7th bool (rdi+6) is 0, then it jumps to .LBB0_6, adds 2 to rcx (which previously held rdi+4), then jumps to .LBB_11 and eventually compares rdi+6 with rax which holds 'end'.",0
5054_irc_c++-general,ViralTaco,Sounds like it can do that in a cycle,0
5054_irc_c++-general,kalven,"I'm saying that at the point where it has tested the bool at rdi+6 and decides to jump, it already knows that the function is going to return false.; do you understand what I'm getting at?",0
5054_irc_c++-general,ViralTaco,only if everything is executed concurrently; And if it was it'd be slower,0
5054_irc_c++-general,kalven,wat,0
5054_irc_c++-general,ViralTaco,speculative execution,0
5054_irc_c++-general,kalven,"ViralTaco: look at the asm output, do you understand what line 17 is doing?",0
5054_irc_c++-general,InPhase,kalven: I hadn't even looked carefully at the end. That makes no sense.,0
5054_irc_c++-general,ViralTaco,1sec; je,0
5054_irc_c++-general,InPhase,"kalven: For ""all_of"" the return value decision is already made the moment it jumped.",0
5054_irc_c++-general,ViralTaco,conditional jump,0
5054_irc_c++-general,kalven,"InPhase: right; ViralTaco: so do you agree that at that point, we know that the function is going to return false?",0
5054_irc_c++-general,ViralTaco,yeah but no; we agree; sorta,0
5054_irc_c++-general,kalven,sorta? is there a case where at line 17 the function would ever return true?,0
5054_irc_c++-general,ViralTaco,"the part of the cpu that ""knows"" the state might not be the part that depends on it",0
5054_irc_c++-general,InPhase,"kalven: It seems to me it would be perfectly sensible to jump to mov al, 0; ret; Or otherwise at the end of the last comparison just fall through to mov al, 1; ret",0
5054_irc_c++-general,kalven,InPhase: yes!,0
5054_irc_c++-general,ViralTaco,Ok we needs someone who knows x86 better than I do at this point,0
5054_irc_c++-general,kalven,"InPhase: it's like it inlined std::find_if_not, but didn't think deeply enough about how the result was going to be used",0
5054_irc_c++-general,ViralTaco,To me the problem with that is what the fuck happens if 2 jumps happen in the same cycle?; Does it just say fuck it and return twice?,0
5054_irc_c++-general,kalven,are you just trolling now?,0
5054_irc_c++-general,InPhase,"kalven: It seems like maybe this was a for loop that got unrolled, but then this monstrosity at the end is unrolling leftover trying to check for the ending condition on an iterator.",0
5054_irc_c++-general,ViralTaco,Do you understand what I'm saying kalven?,0
5054_irc_c++-general,InPhase,kalven: Which I think might just kill the unrolling advantages.,0
5054_irc_c++-general,kalven,ViralTaco: do you?,0
5054_irc_c++-general,InPhase,"ViralTaco: Two jumps wouldn't happen. There's a single instruction pointer path.; ViralTaco: While there's predictive loading of data, it achieves the same effect as that single path.",0
5054_irc_c++-general,ViralTaco,still trying to understand; I guess that's how it'd probably work in a for loop but with std::any_of it can have a different use than this; all_of; same thing; and you're the one asking for a copy of the bool in your predicate...,0
5054_irc_c++-general,kalven,ViralTaco: so?,0
5054_irc_c++-general,ViralTaco,"So I guess now that I understand it better, yeah, I agree. I don't think it can be easily implemented the way you'd like it to be; Is that what you want <a href=""https://gcc.godbolt.org/z/g3ijB-"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://gcc.godbolt.org/z/g3ijB-</a> kalven ?",0

5781_irc_c++-general,O2Leak,"I was just using this so that I can figure out how to get the 6502 CPU emulator I found working; so next step is to set up the paged memory emulation and start writing my own kernel; b_jonas: this thing will have access to ~1GB of space when all is said and done (not all at once, mind you)",0
5781_irc_c++-general,b_jonas,one gigabyte? what kind of magic banking would you use for that? the 6502 only has 16 bits of address,0
5781_irc_c++-general,O2Leak,"oh also to be able to load ROMs to arbitrary memory positions from files; I'll use memory locations inside of the statically allocated memory to act as external address registers for the banked memory; so I'll have half of the address space point to statically positioned memory locations and the other half be a window into a larger memory space; some of said statically positioned memory locations will represent a portion of the banked address; so you push the bank address to memory, then read from the bank like it's normal memory; top 8K will be kernel ROM, next 8K will be I/O and special registers (including bank address), next 16K will be statically allocated RAM, then the bottom 32K will be able to slide over the address space described by the special registers",0
5781_irc_c++-general,b_jonas,what?; that doesn't sound right,0
5781_irc_c++-general,O2Leak,basically I'll extend the address space by using memory locations as part of the address bus,0
5781_irc_c++-general,b_jonas,"O2Leak: the 6502 has easy access to the first 256 bytes, and stack in the 256 bytes above that, so it's probably better to have that part statically allocated",0
5781_irc_c++-general,O2Leak,"nah, that'll be able to slide so I can use that to multitask programs",0
5781_irc_c++-general,b_jonas,"also, having just one window sounds a bit limiting",0
5781_irc_c++-general,O2Leak,"just swap what bank and you swap the currently running program; it will be able to slide at 16K intervals; so you could slide it to either have its low 16K point to a certain region, or its high 16K, but the whole 32K is contiguous in memory; this would allow you to set up a program in the high 16K, then slide it to the low 16K to start execution; though that part's all the software side of things; which is why I need to write my own kernel; eventually I do plan to have this be a real physical device, I just figure that if I emulate first I can work out the major kinks before even trying to put the hardware together",0
5781_irc_c++-general,b_jonas,"O2Leak: dunno, this doesn't sound like a good idea to me because now if you actually want to switch banks, you'll lose the advantage of the 6502 zero page accesses",0
5781_irc_c++-general,O2Leak,"if I'm being honest this project is in fairly early stages and part of why I'm emulating first is to figure out if that kind of thing is feasible before tearing my hair out with the real hardware; so I very well may have the low 16K be static, then the next 16K be a banked area, then next 16K be IO, then the next 16K be kernel / system config; I just know I want my top memory to be kernel ROM",0
5781_irc_c++-general,b_jonas,O2Leak: why not have multiple banked areas?; and why do you want such a large area for IO and kernel?,0
5781_irc_c++-general,O2Leak,like I said; it's all tentative,0
5781_irc_c++-general,b_jonas,especially since the kernel can also use the banking feature to swap in stuff,0
5781_irc_c++-general,O2Leak,I'm still trying to figure out optimal memory map,0
5781_irc_c++-general,b_jonas,presumably,0
5781_irc_c++-general,O2Leak,"and yes, multiple banked areas was the original idea; I may do 8K banks with each having one byte of extra address space; (so each bank requires one statically allocated memory location to describe the extra memory locations)",0
5781_irc_c++-general,b_jonas,"O2Leak: or you could look at actual 6502 machines with banking, though most of them won't have 1 gigabyte of memory, but there exist ones with like 128 kilobytes or so",0
5781_irc_c++-general,O2Leak,there are about 20 different memory maps I've explored so far with up to 4 banks so like I said; still tentative,0
5781_irc_c++-general,b_jonas,"ok, good luck",0
5781_irc_c++-general,O2Leak,"and yeah I'll probably take a look at those, the only thing set in stone is to use banking that utilises pre-specified memory locations for address extension; still haven't decided on a good deal else about the banking",0
5781_irc_c++-general,b_jonas,"sure, that part certainly makes sense if you're using the 6502 and want large memory",0
5781_irc_c++-general,O2Leak,"also I *just* got the emulator running haha so now the real fun starts; I'm even thinking about using multiple 6502s that use the same kernel space but different banked memory (and run out of phase with each other, similar to how the VIC chip did in VIC-20 and C64); so their ROM code space would be shared since that never changes but the RAM and IO would be personal except where you need a connection; that will actually be rather easy to spin up in this emulator to test before ever needing to deal with the headache of the logic connections",0
5781_irc_c++-general,b_jonas,O2Leak: now that would be tricky to get right; multiple cpus that is; especially in real hardware; unless some of the cpus do only very specialized tasks; and there's one main one doing the control,0
5781_irc_c++-general,O2Leak,well; they'd have separate RAM spaces; and not actually interact code-wise; they would just share a code-base for the ROM-based stuff and their clocks would be out of phase with each other so there's never a data collision; then their interactions would take place over an I/O connection as though it's another machine entirely,0
5781_irc_c++-general,b_jonas,"O2Leak: um, so you'd add a separate gigabyte of memory for each cpu?",0
5781_irc_c++-general,O2Leak,pretty much,0
5781_irc_c++-general,b_jonas,hmm,0
5781_irc_c++-general,O2Leak,or however much I eventually decide each one gets; but then the ROM chips would all be shared and have a chip like the TMS9904 for the clock driving; could even make it so that the paged RAM partially overlaps; so they can directly share some memory space between a given two CPUs; but that would take some patience to program a kernel for; I guess figuring out what memory map setup to use really is the next step,0
5944_irc_c++-general,symm-,"what's the * 0xFF part?; is it a multiply? or an overloaded operator* ?; ok sorry I feel stupid but I just can't figure out what multiplying by 255 would do in any context :); oh. duh.

8023_irc_c++-general,victorqueiroz,"I see. So does Vim offers support for CMake? I was trying VS Code but it isn't the same as CLion. It's faster but not the same flow, you know? So I was thinking about VIM",0
8023_irc_c++-general,InPhase,"victorqueiroz: You don't need support for cmake in vim. You use vim to edit your files, and open another terminal window to run your builds and execute the program.; victorqueiroz: Setup virtual desktops with keyboard shortcuts if you haven't already, and the Linux desktop system is already superior to most IDEs. You keep one virtual desktop for editing code, one for building and executing, another for web pages open to documentation, etc.; Then you rapidly switch between these with keyboard shortcuts, and your development will be speedy and efficient.; :)",0

9627_irc_c++-general,RandomReader,"yes, but I don't think it's quite as visible as it doesn't cover quite the same range as C++ in terms of development; because C++ offers so many abstraction (and abstraction building tools) it seems to be used for more of the kinds of software people want package management for",0

9828_irc_c++-general,CaffeineVaccine,"there could give that has helped you throughout the years?; Hello, so my goal is to comprehend a fairly advanced C++ file that's around ~1000 lines of code. There's alot going on in it. So I'm wondering what the best strategies are to fully comprehend it are. I guess my plan, right now, is to just play around with it a little bit and basically just keep staring and staring and looking and reading the code until stuff finally clicks. Is there any advice that any veterans out",1
9828_irc_c++-general,RandomReader,"CaffeineVaccine - I think C++ is one of the most difficult languages to read cold because the syntax is so context-dependent and un-Google-able .. but in general I think there are a couple main things I'm doing when reading code; one is just pattern recognition, like ""for (int i = 0; i &lt; foo; ++i)"" is probably iterating over something by index .. that's only as good as the patterns you already know, but it's a major part of dealing with code in general, and it's the sort of thing you basically just learn with experience; I don't read those individually unless I carefully slow down and focus, I skim it as ""iterating"" and only go back if there seems to be something strange / doesn't make sense / there's a potential bug; getting a sense of the overall code flow I tend to do by mentally tracing execution through logical groups, try to get an overview of it .. e.g. ""starts in main, calls some Config-things so probably initializes configuration, starts this loop so probably event-based, event Foo seems to do something with a GUI library, event Bar seems to do something with file I/O"" etc",2
9828_irc_c++-general,CaffeineVaccine,"RandomReader: Thanks for the advice. I think the best follow-up question to ask with that is, which resource should I turn to, to learn a bunch of patterns, since my pattern knowledge is fairly limited?",0
