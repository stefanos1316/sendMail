4101_clojurians_2018,Marketta,"What is the best way to use module written `deps.edn` and `clj` in `lein`? I guess deploy this module to `clojars`, but how to deploy to `clojars` without `lein`? In other words I did module using `deps.edn`, but I want to let developers who use `lein` use it also.; it is cljs module if it matter; BTW it is really hard to find articles in google, because clj / clojure / deps.edn are too general words to find solutions about new way of developing using `clj` command. It could be very useful if Clojure community start to use better (more unique) name for this solution.",1
4101_clojurians_2018,Charlene,<@Marketta> tools.deps.alpha is good name for that,2
4101_clojurians_2018,Magali,There are a list of tools at <https://github.com/clojure/tools.deps.alpha/wiki/Tools>,2
4101_clojurians_2018,Marketta,"<@Magali> sorry to point you directly, but you are the one  who can appreciate this feedback maybe AFAIK.",0
4101_clojurians_2018,Magali,"Yeah, sorry I don’t have a solution for that",0
4101_clojurians_2018,Marketta,"Sure, I am saying this more to consider it in the future; I mean core Clojure team make trends :wink:; ok so one way is to use `deps-deploy` with `clj` to let developers who use `lein` add this dependency. Other alternatives?; Hmm potentially make `deps.edn` which point to module using git commit hash like `github-kwladyka/form-validator {:git/url ""<https://github.com/kwladyka/form-validator-cljs.git>"" :sha ""3674d524d9d4019fcc494788e3fc878f6bd794e7""}` and use this file with `lein`.; So I found 2 solutions to make it use with `lein`. Will it be fine for you as developers to create `deps.edn` using `lein` to add dependency like this? What is the standard about it?; I am going sleep now, but I will read your feedback tomorrow. Thank you!",0

4179_clojurians_2018,Alita,"clojurians, i'm trying to build functions on top of my database to work with users. for example I have a function get-user which takes a username and returns their row in the users table. my problem is this: I want to be able to swap out the database that get-user uses to grab users (for mocking, testing, etc). one solution would be to have each function take an extra db param as argument so get-user would have the following type get-user : db * username -&gt; user-row. the other is to have the db as some global parameter that I can swap out. both of these solutions don't suffice in my mind. the first has the problem of having to pass the same db to every function call, whereas the second requires that all of my function calls access the same db (i might want them to access different ones).; in haskell i'd use a monad, so that get user would have the following type get-user : username -&gt; db user and then i could call rundb : db * db a -&gt; a to get my value out in the context of a certain database.; i like the haskell way, but we are in clojure land now. my other idea was to write a function that takes a database and returns a map of user database functions specialized to that db. this seems silly though and not idiomatic clojure. what is the best way to accomplish my goal?",1
4179_clojurians_2018,Carleen,"<https://github.com/tolitius/mount> is a good solution for that, allows you to treat db as a global object but is easy to redefine the state in your tests",2
4179_clojurians_2018,Alita,"thank you, i've heard of mount before.; is it considered the best way to do it?; i'm very averse to global state :neutral_face:",0
4179_clojurians_2018,Carleen,"Component is also an alternative, but yes this seems to be the recommended way to handle app state since each piece you define with mount can be stopped, restarted, and reset in a deterministic way. If you create a luminus template like `lein new luminus test-app +postgres +site` you can see mount and hugsql in action for how it handles test environments and separating db functions from db state.",2
4179_clojurians_2018,Machelle,"<https://github.com/stuartsierra/component> for reference; Not to say that this is a solution to your problem — But if you were to mark a global definition as dynamic, you can use `binding` to redefine it in tests.; So you can define some global constant: `(def  ^:dynamic *some-global-constant* 12)`, and make up your mind later and use: `(binding [*some-global-constant* 42] …)` to locally redefine the global constant. But that is not the elegant solution in this case I think.",2
4179_clojurians_2018,Kirsten,"in the case where the db is a param to your function, you could also have a partial fn for your application with db already bound to it",0
4179_clojurians_2018,Valene,"<@Alita> you can implement a similar pattern to the Haskell monadic approach in Clojure, if you like; there are many ways to do it, but one could be to define a simple data structure to describe the database function you want to be executed:
```
;; get-user
;; example output: [:db/user ""someuser342""]
(defn get-user [uname]
  [:db/user uname])

(defn run-db! [descriptor]
  ... )
```; if you can make the descriptors of your db commands simple enough, a multimethod for the `run-db!` function is quite nice:

```
(defmulti run-db! first)

(defmethod run-db! :default [_]
  (throw (RuntimeException. ""Unknown database function."")))

(defmethod run-db! :db/user 
  [[_ uname]]
  ;; fetch user row
  )
```",2

3086_elmlangB_2017,Alvin,"chadtech, you're awesome; I am studying from the feldman elm MEAP text.  There is a PhotoGroove app you build.  The .elm has a hardcoded record with filenames; I want the .elm to access a csv file I will generate containing the filenames; I don't know how to do OS file.read operations in elm; can I just set it equal to a variable, eg list_of_photos = ""<http://0.0.0.0:4000/photofilenames.csv>; """,0
3086_elmlangB_2017,Luana,Yeah you cant access the users files. Browsers dont permit that as a security measure. But you can read a file the user voluntarily uploads.,0

3086_elmlangB_2017,Luana,So heres what you need to do (to do this in an Elm project):,0
3086_elmlangB_2017,Alvin,I have a phoenix app with jpgs in static directory and elm accessing it through localhost,0
3086_elmlangB_2017,Luana,"Oh okay. Maybe I dont know what you are trying to do. Do you want to read the csv hosted by that phoenix app? Or read a csv on the users computer? I guess if you are doing this locally, that would be the same source.",0
3086_elmlangB_2017,Alvin,"There's a phoenix server with some jpgs.  In the same directory will be a csv with filenames of all the jpgs.

3086_elmlangB_2017,Luana,Okay then I think you need to make an http request to `localhost:PORT/path/to/csv.csv/` then  youll have to parse that response into the data structure you want,0
3086_elmlangB_2017,Alvin,"awesome; okay so to do that I would set it as a variable? such as ""photo_filenames = localhost/photos.csv""",0
3086_elmlangB_2017,Luana,"Uh, maybe. If they are in the same location as those jpgs, and you are fetching those jpgs, then I would think you could fetch the csv the same way by passing it “photos.csv”, how do you get those jpgs?",0
3086_elmlangB_2017,Alvin,"then to make it into a record with the same type as above I would... String.split and then List.map (\url -&gt; { url = url}) urls in ( { model | photo = photos}, Cmd.none ); the jpgs are in a folder being served by phoenix, a static folder",0

3086_elmlangB_2017,Luana,"Sorry, I dont think I understand what you are doing well enough to give you clear advice. I could help show you how to load a csv file from a back end source, parse a csv file, or request photos from urls in that csv, but I dont know which step specifically you are on.; Maybe if you had a code snippet from your project I could look at it.",0
3086_elmlangB_2017,Alvin,"exactly what you said.

3185_elmlangB_2017,Ellen,"What is the best strategy to decode and represent potentially different JSON payloads?

3185_elmlangB_2017,Lee,"<@Ellen> It's a lot easier to write decoders when you know what you want the data to look like on the Elm side.

3409_elmlangB_2017,Myrtie,Anyone have a good example of using Form validation when the input has been touched and so on ?,1
3409_elmlangB_2017,Lilian,<@Cristopher> `style-elements` include a modal function that is meant to be used with the rest of the library; <@Myrtie> I made my own for my project: <https://github.com/cjduncana/elm-panama-sign-up-front-end/blob/master/src/Validation.elm>,2
3409_elmlangB_2017,Myrtie,Thank you ! I give it a look :slightly_smiling_face:,0
3409_elmlangB_2017,Burma,<@Myrtie> here's another example: <https://ellie-app.com/kf8TQGfzVa1/0>,2
3409_elmlangB_2017,Lilian,"I was gonna use that originally in my project, but because I am using a debouncer for the validation, I needed to distinguish when it was dirty and not validated.",0
3409_elmlangB_2017,Myrtie,<@Burma> does that one validate it right away or when the user has moved to the next input?,0
3409_elmlangB_2017,Burma,"The way I've set it up, it validates on input, not on blur; but the initial empty state is not validated until the user starts typing",0
3409_elmlangB_2017,Myrtie,So in my case I should just validate it on blur instead ?,0
3409_elmlangB_2017,Burma,Is that the behavior you want? :slightly_smiling_face:,0
3409_elmlangB_2017,Myrtie,"Yeah, but that would not solve it .; Normally in forms I've notice that the first validation occur when the user goes away from the input and then it goes over to key strokes .; Don't know how to do that in a solid way.",0
3409_elmlangB_2017,Burma,Hmmm... why do you want that hybrid approach?,0
3409_elmlangB_2017,Myrtie,"Designers....; I see it doh, you don't want to validate when the user is inputing his email, and if the user does it wrong you want to give him feedback if he did it right.",0
3409_elmlangB_2017,Burma,"ah, the ""after first blur"" thing is per field?",0
3409_elmlangB_2017,Myrtie,Yeah; And I need to only validate per field.,0
3409_elmlangB_2017,Burma,"So <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/ericgj/elm-validation/1.0.1/Validation> has three values in its union type:

3409_elmlangB_2017,Rex,"it is configurable on the backend and what those names are i don't know at compile time necessarily; later? possibly, because we might be comparing the output of two files - one indicating all possible devices that are configured to run and those that actually ran; but for right now it is not a big deal",0
3409_elmlangB_2017,Burma,"yeah, just wondering if a Dict is the data structure you want",0

3409_elmlangB_2017,Rex,if i could fold them into the structure and make a list that might be best (add a field called `id` with the value of the name of the object,0
3409_elmlangB_2017,Burma,it really depends on how you want to use those values on the Elm side :slightly_smiling_face:,0

I can call that file from `root/ElmApp/index.html` with no problem. If, however, I try to call the `elm.js` file from a server side rendered template at `root/main.rs`I get the app with broken links to the images.

730_elmlangB_2019,Jeneva,are you using relative or absolute links in your image sources?,0

730_elmlangB_2019,Almeda,relative,0
730_elmlangB_2019,Enrique,One way is to pass in the root path to the images directory into the application and build the image files with that; shield yourself from any changes between local and remote paths,2
730_elmlangB_2019,Almeda,"So right now the app source code uses paths like ` src = ""src/images/MyImage.png""`. Are you suggesting that `src = ""/root/ElmApp/src/images""` would be correct in both scenarios?",0
730_elmlangB_2019,Gilda,<@Almeda> the correct path depends on what path your server is serving it at. It's not really an Elm question; You'll need to look at how your server is configured,0
730_elmlangB_2019,Enrique,I imagine that there is a different root path when you are on your server vs local,0
730_elmlangB_2019,Almeda,"To be clear, when I say that static html file loads the image assets correctly, that static file is being served by the same server as the template, which is why I'm puzzled.; I understand this is somewhat off topic. I appreciate the assistance in any case.",0
730_elmlangB_2019,Gilda,"<@Almeda> with a relative path in an IMG tag, it's relative to the location of the HTML page you're on.; So if you're static html page is at a different path to the rendered template page then the relative path for your IMG tag needs to be different",2
730_elmlangB_2019,Almeda,even if the javascript file is at the same location in both scenarios?,0
730_elmlangB_2019,Gilda,The location of the JavaScript file that created the IMG tag isn't relevant to the path that IMG tag loads it's image from,0
730_elmlangB_2019,Almeda,Got it. Thanks. I assumed that the javascript would be looking for a file relative to its own location.,0
730_elmlangB_2019,Gilda,"From the perspective of Elm it's not a path, it's just a string; When you add an IMG tag to the DOM the browser interprets the `src` attribute of that tag as a path and attempts to fetch it",0
730_elmlangB_2019,Almeda,Got it sorted. My asset path was actually correct but my path for the rendered template was at a level below what the server was serving the assets at. So I had the server providing routes for `localhost:3000/myapp` but the template rendered version at `localhost:3000/myapp/template`. By providing a route at `localhost:3000/template` now the relative path to the images is appropriate for both.,0

1949_elmlangB_2018,Oralee,"anyone know of an elm project or literature that demonstrates a good pattern for managing the user session in an elm SPA? not the technical aspects of authen, but rather Elm abstractions in the model/update/msg; just throwing code at the wall in my existing SPA, i ended up with Msg.AutoLogin which is the first Cmd of the app. if Flags.sessionId exists, it tries to log the user in, transitioning to Msg.HandleLoginResponse which transitions to Msg.Bootstrap that makes the requests to actually load the data. if there is no sessionId on app boot, then Msg.AutoLogin transitions directly to Msg.Bootstrap.; seems to kinda work now; also, i've built somewhat of a pinterest-style image gallery where images quilt together so that they flush with each other. Anyone happen to've built this sort of thing? for now I have a datastructure i call Grid that manages three Array columns .`Grid.addImage` will append the image to the shortest column.; i'll see about extracting it into a demo.; wow, great; can't believe i missed that beast; one of my biggest challenges is avoiding circular deps",1
1949_elmlangB_2018,Thomasine,hi everyone; I have a dumb question - I want to tag a class on a div and add an external css stylesheet to style the div; the docs dont seem to have an easy answer on how to do this,0
1949_elmlangB_2018,Tinisha,"How would you do this in a non-Elm project? Like using `&lt;link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""theme.css""&gt;` in the header?",0
1949_elmlangB_2018,Thomasine,"ideally - I would like to do it so I can include a css sheet in the elm file and don't have to bury the thing in an html doc; `import ""mystylesheet""`; this gets important when scaling a project; also it prevents hot reloading if i cant do this",0
1949_elmlangB_2018,Tinisha,"With Elm-Css you can style your components without an external css file, in which case you are doing something like `import ""mystylesheet""`; But to your first question, if you embed your project using `Elm.Main.fullscreen()` or `Elm.Main.embed()` you can just have your css in your html.; And if you want an internal styling library like Elm-Css and an external style sheet then I dont think they conflict. Im using Elm-Css and manually written Css at the same time in a project.",0
1949_elmlangB_2018,Thomasine,"so elm-css is like scss or similar, it doesnt seem to allow importing a vanilla css file on cursory inspection",0
1949_elmlangB_2018,Tinisha,"Yeah, correct, you cant dynamically import vanilla css into Elm-Css. But whats your use case? You could import vanilla css _and_ use Elm-Css",0
1949_elmlangB_2018,Thomasine,"thats not; ...; :frowning:; if i import vanilla css stylesheets it means i dont get hot reloading which is painful; AH; i needed this <https://github.com/tapio/live-server>; all good now; nope, nope nvm - it can't recompile the elm file; dangit",0
1949_elmlangB_2018,Burl,"<@Oralee> oh yeah, sorry. The app is an infinite ""canvas"" sort of thing (hard to explain but it's a new programming environment, see <http://darklang.com|darklang.com>), and you hold down keys to move around. We have the same problem with mouse scroll too. ",0
1949_elmlangB_2018,Oralee,"the other generic solution is to ensure a function will only run once per some interval (debounce). most common way to run into it is `window.on('scroll', doWork)`. instead you can `debounce(1000, doWork)` and make doWork run at its own resolution during the 1000ms cooldown.; sorry if you already knew all. but those are definitely things i've had to do in Elm like any other interactive application; also, when using ports, it helps to short-circuit in JS where possible instead of making your subscriptions (in Elm) do it",0

1949_elmlangB_2018,Tinisha,"<@Mika> I spent a lot of time on this problem, and I did something similar to what <@Oralee> suggests. Heres what I did:
0 Listen to key ups and downs on the whole window, on the JavaScript side of things
1 Send over “key events” through the port, which in my case was json { shiftIsDown : Bool, metaIsDown: Bool, ctrlIsDown: Bool, keyCode : Int }
2 Decode that key event and do whatever you need to do with it.
I also needed browser specific key codes, which Ohanhi’s great package doesnt support. So I forked it as `Chadtech/keyboard-extra-browser`",0
1949_elmlangB_2018,Oralee,"had to do it in requestAnimationFrame and, last i  checked, it's just not reliable",0
1949_elmlangB_2018,Tinisha,"Most people take this “keep a model of what keys are up and down” approach, but it almost always runs into some kind of problem, like the key comes up, but somehow its not removed from the model and it just hangs out forever contaminating all your key cmds. If you just want to know if shift, ctrl, and cmd are pressed thats contained in the key event itself and doesnt need to be maintained in your state.",0
1949_elmlangB_2018,Joane,Fair enough! I guess now is an OK time for me to switch to just compiling to JS and bring that in :slightly_smiling_face:  Thanks,0
1949_elmlangB_2018,Tinisha,"Compiling to JS seems like a good move, but you could also make a div fill up your entire screen and style that.; like a `&lt;div class=""main""/&gt;` that contains everything",0

2128_elmlangB_2018,Ronna,is there any way to override async behavior? I need to make a few requests before I let the user interact with my app..,1

2128_elmlangB_2018,Tiny,Do you want the app to be visible or just show a spinner during that initial loading phase?,0
2128_elmlangB_2018,Ronna,"I dont realy care what the user sees, its better if he knows that he cannot interact with the app though; can I tack on Cmd Msgs on the init? so I give a whole list of them?; somehow...; ah I think I might be able to map the msgs and use Cmd.batch in my Main.elm init function; lemme try",0
2128_elmlangB_2018,Tiny,"There are a few things you probably want to do:

1. Use `Task` to combine all your requests into a single `Cmd`
2. Model your app with an initializing and loaded states
3. Initialize the app in initializing state and return the single command to do the HTTP request
4. Have your view render a special loading view or spinner while the app is in the initializing state
5. Transition to loaded state once the HTTP requests succeed",2
2128_elmlangB_2018,Darci,"What <@Tiny> said; I find converting all my Http requests to Tasks works well, so that I can use `Task.map*` which gives me a nice interface in which to aggregate all my dependencies up; although they *have* to run in sequence :disappointed:",0
2128_elmlangB_2018,Tiny,"Here's something more concrete sketching out what I'm suggesting :slightly_smiling_face:

Explicitly model the states of the app:
```
type App
  = Initializing
  | Loaded Model

type alias Model = { user : User, articles : List Articles }
```

Combine HTTP requests and return as a single command from init:
```
type Msg = InitialData (Result Http.Error (User, List Articles))

init : (App, Cmd Msg)
init =
  (Initializing, Task.attempt InitialData initialFetches)

initialFetches : Task Http.Error (User, List Article)
initialFetches =
  -- when both requests succeed, return a tuple with the two responses
  Task.map2 (\user articles -&gt; (user, articles))
    (Http.toTask getUser)
    (Http.toTask getArticles)
```

Transition to loaded and construct your initial model on success:

```
update : Msg -&gt; App -&gt; (App, Cmd Msg)
update msg app =
  case msg of
    InitialData (Ok (user, articles)) -&gt; Loaded { user = user, articles = articles }
    ...
```

Render some different UI to let the user know they can't do anything for now:
```
view : App -&gt; Html Msg
view app =
  case app of
    Initializing -&gt; spinnerView
    Loaded model -&gt; viewModel model

2430_elmlangB_2018,Hyun,"`&lt;|` makes sense if you have a complicated last argument to a function and don’t really want to force it into being a pipeline data transformation operation, like `Html.div [] &lt;| x ++ y and then some`",0

2968_elmlangB_2018,Sung,<@Maya> a common solution is to create a module called `Env` that is different for each environment and compile in the version for that environment when you compile,2

4592_elmlangB_2018,Letitia,"Hi, I would like to encode a union type while skipping some of the constructors. I thought of making a function `encoder : MyType -&gt; Maybe Value` and then a function `listEncoder : List MyType -&gt; Value` where I would use something like `List.filterMap` to get rid of the `Nothings`.

5849_elmlangB_2018,Wendi,I think it’s not a big chunk to have in there,0

5849_elmlangB_2018,Masako,"hehe, that was the estimate I was just about to make too",0

5849_elmlangB_2018,Masako,Gotcha,0
5849_elmlangB_2018,Shyla,Also that figure is not withstanding browser optimisations,0
5849_elmlangB_2018,Masako,"Well, easy enough then. Simpler to code too.; Not going to try to prematurely optimize. Just figured I'd do a sanity check.; Thanks! :slightly_smiling_face:",0
5849_elmlangB_2018,Wendi,what is “Sweet F all?”,0
5849_elmlangB_2018,Masako,Does accessing local storage work when using reactor?,0
5849_elmlangB_2018,Phebe,My code when I optimize prematurely... <https://media.giphy.com/media/8lUDy1HTU9vRm/giphy.gif>,0
5849_elmlangB_2018,Masako,"sweet f*** all, which is a colloquialism for 'nothing'",0
5849_elmlangB_2018,Wendi,Yes for “development” according to <https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/billstclair/elm-localstorage/latest/> but not for any real persistence,0
5849_elmlangB_2018,Masako,"Yeah, though he's using simulated ports that do something. I'm not using his package, just trying to access local storage directly. Wasn't sure if it was a general limitation or if I need to simulate ports like he did.; I haven't dug into it yet to see what actually happens there :slightly_smiling_face:; But if I do an elm make and just run the index file, it should work right, so if nothing's showing up in local storage, I've probably done something wrong. :slightly_smiling_face:",0
5849_elmlangB_2018,Wendi,ok:),0
5849_elmlangB_2018,Masako,"Oh, I get it now. Reactor won't have the ports in the html file, obviously. So yeah, I'd have to simulate ports to make it work in reactor. Thanks :slightly_smiling_face:",0
5849_elmlangB_2018,Wendi,correct :smiley:,0
5849_elmlangB_2018,Masako,"Total noob question that I'm having trouble finding the explanation for. When something has a type of `Cmd Msg` for example, is that a compound type of some sort, or does Cmd take a Msg as parameter or something? I don't quite understand the notation.",0
5849_elmlangB_2018,Carolynn,`Msg` refers to the `Msg` type you have defined in your module. So it's a command that returns a particular `Msg`. If that makes sense.,0
5849_elmlangB_2018,Masako,"Yeah, I guess so.; Thanks, btw. :slightly_smiling_face:",0
5849_elmlangB_2018,Carolynn,"sure, hope it helps",0
5849_elmlangB_2018,Masako,It did. I'm clarifying it further about reading more about ports right now. :slightly_smiling_face:; Guess I'm a little confused about when it's Cmd Msg and when it's Cmd msg and why.,0
5849_elmlangB_2018,Shyla,`msg` is when you don’t know what type it is,0
5849_elmlangB_2018,Phebe,"<@Masako> if it helps, you can read types like `type Foo bar = ...` like this: ""whatever the type of `bar` is, a `Foo` can work with"".
It does not mean that there necessary will be `bar` contained in a `Foo` instance. For example: `type Maybe a = Just a | Nothing` means that `Maybe` may or may not contain an instance of `a` inside.",0
5849_elmlangB_2018,Shyla,You can’t use `msg` when you interact with the type within; but it means you can build a helper that works across several types,0
5849_elmlangB_2018,Phebe,"Consider something stranger `type alias Extractor a b = a -&gt; b` ; here, I'm saying that I chose to name `Extractor a b` a function that will take an `a` and will return a `b`, whatever an `a` and a `b` will be when I use it.",0
5849_elmlangB_2018,Masako,"Ah ok. I think that makes sense.; I guess where this started is that I want my page to load content from local storage on load, so I'm trying to figure out how to kick that off, and to understand the messaging that happens in the process. :slightly_smiling_face:",0
5849_elmlangB_2018,Phebe,"When I do this, I can later write functions like this: `extractAll : Extractor a b -&gt; List a -&gt; List b` which means that if you provide me an `Extractor` that takes an `a` and returns a `b` and a `List` of `a`s, I can provide you with a `List` of `b`s :slightly_smiling_face:",0
5849_elmlangB_2018,Shyla,"For example:
```
toImg : Image -&gt; Html msg
toImg image =
    case image of
        Default -&gt; img [ src ""default.png"" ] []
```
msg here is “unknown type”, so that it fits in with other `Html ...`; so I can use that with things that return `Html Page.Msg`; but at some point, I have to turn it into a known type; Its the same with Cmd, thats why in SPAs you’ll see `Cmd.map` etc for turning other types into your root type",0
5849_elmlangB_2018,Masako,"Aha, that makes sense actually. I was wondering how the ports returning Cmd msg still worked when update needed to return a Cmd Msg",0
5849_elmlangB_2018,Phebe,"That's because the compiler is smart enough to fill in the ""blanks"" for you (most of the times, and when it cannot, it'll tell you).",0
5849_elmlangB_2018,Shyla,They must still be all the same type of course,0
5849_elmlangB_2018,Masako,"Right. I've worked with F# and Haskell in the past and they do a lot of  the same stuff. It's mostly about getting it in context.; yeah, of course.",0
5849_elmlangB_2018,Shyla,"Its just the compiler acknowledging this snippet of code doesn’t need to know what it is, just that it fits with everything else like it",0
5849_elmlangB_2018,Masako,"So a related question then, which is what brought me to trying to figure this out to start. If I want something to happen when the application loads, it should be a command (or commands) in the tuple returned by `init` right?; Which should then get passed to `update`?",0
5849_elmlangB_2018,Phebe,Yup :slightly_smiling_face:,0
5849_elmlangB_2018,Shyla,"Yes, sort of; The `Cmd` is executed by the runtime; And the resulting `Msg` passed to `update`; (or `Msg`s)",0
5849_elmlangB_2018,Phebe,"To be more precise, whatever you want to happen *after* the update (including messy, side-effecty JS) has to be returned as a `Cmd` that may or may not result in `Msg`s being given to `update` later on.",0
5849_elmlangB_2018,Masako,"Right. So if all I want to do is send a message to `update`, how to I phrase that as a `Cmd`?",0
5849_elmlangB_2018,Phebe,<@Masako> you don't necessarily need to.,0
5849_elmlangB_2018,Shyla,"Don’t try to trick `update` into firing, instead run the function you want.",0
5849_elmlangB_2018,Masako,Oh. Heh.,0
5849_elmlangB_2018,Phebe,"If what you want doesn't have side-effects, you'd be better just wrapping the thing you want in a function that may or may not be used by `update` when the right `Msg` arrives, or maybe call `update` with the appropriate `Msg`.",0
5849_elmlangB_2018,Masako,"So say I have a port I want to fire to start the load, just fire the port directly?",0
5849_elmlangB_2018,Shyla,Yes; Or a function that does; If you wish to do it in several places,0
5849_elmlangB_2018,Phebe,"Well, a port being a side-effect, you can return the `Cmd Msg` it'll return yes.",0
5849_elmlangB_2018,Masako,Right.,0
5849_elmlangB_2018,Phebe,"Typical use-case: you start your app and want to know the size of the viewport, so you fire an appropriate `Cmd Msg` that will query that information for you.; You could also provide it as a `Flag` but it'll require you to insure your JS provides a `Flag` that will give the right value to you.",0
5849_elmlangB_2018,Masako,"Does this make sense then, assuming I call the `loadText` port from `init` and handle `LoadLocalComplete` in my update?; From two different files, obviously, index.html and my elm source. Just put them in one snippet :slightly_smiling_face:; Thanks a ton for the help, guys.; Oh hey, it does work. I'd just forgotten to actually update the textarea in view. :slightly_smiling_face:",0
5893_elmlangB_2018,Masako,"Is there an easy way to turn a type into a string and to set a type based on a string for serialization to JSON, for example? Or is there a more elegant way to do it?; Or do I just have to case / if then it?",1

5893_elmlangB_2018,Masako,"Okay. Thanks. :slightly_smiling_face:; It's not a lot of code, just very boilerplate. :slightly_smiling_face:",0
5893_elmlangB_2018,Eldon,"yes, if you do that a lot then some kind of automatic code generation might be useful. (I don't know if such a thing exists yet.)",2
5893_elmlangB_2018,Masako,"Hmm... can I make a decoder for my own type? Like if I have a type `CountMethod`, can I construct a decoder of type `Json.Decode.Decoder CountMethod`? I've made a generic value extracting function with a signature of `Json.Decode.Decoder a -&gt; String -&gt; a -&gt; a` (decoder, string to decode, a default value and the final result), and it'd be nice to do the type decoding by the same pattern.; Basically the function is for error handling and reducing duplication of the `Json.Decode.decodeString` pattern.; Looking at the source for `Json.Decode`, I guess the actual decoding functionality is out in the javascript kernel. Was hoping to find an elm example in there.",0
5893_elmlangB_2018,Eldon,You can just use normal Json.Decode... functions to construct your own decoder.,2

5893_elmlangB_2018,Johanne,"Thanks for the great explanation. It seems like when merging the items are popped off the list? For example, if 2 additions use the same ingredient, only the first one gets merged: <https://ellie-app.com/3VPbYTKGTNFa1>",0

5893_elmlangB_2018,Johanne,"Do you think there’s a way around that? My api just sideloads dependencies, so I cannot depend on lists having the same length",0

5893_elmlangB_2018,Masako,"Found a great example for making a custom decoder in the top comment on this gist, btw. <https://gist.github.com/focusaurus/1085181366a6399414f0b0049ece3750>; Worked like a charm. Just in case anyone is wondering how. :slightly_smiling_face:",0

5893_elmlangB_2018,Johanne,"Oh, sweet!; Yeah, not sure, since you can’t throw in Elm… but in practice that would be a problem with the data, which shouldn’t happen; I suppose Ingredient type could a `Failure | Success ActualIngredient`, like I did for Recipe?; I mean like I did for `Model`; Anyway, seems like `Dict.get` is a great way to go, thanks :slightly_smiling_face:",0

Code could possibly be cleaned a bit to make it clearer. Basically I removed `helper`, then decode in stages so that when ingredients have been decoded, that is given to `additionDecoder` which will find corresponding ingredient during actual decoding, and fails if none is found.",0
5893_elmlangB_2018,Johanne,"Oh, I like that… composing decoders does seem preferable to the helper",0
5893_elmlangB_2018,Eldon,"yes, this is actually a problem I have with an app I'm creating currently, so I'll try to use this same approach there next; btw, my problem is decoding dependencies from elm.json for packages, which looks like:

        ""elm/bytes"": ""1.0.0 &lt;= v &lt; 2.0.0"",

6140_elmlangB_2018,Alisha,"If I have a type `Loadable` that can be either `Loading`, `LoadingError err`, or `Loaded result` and I want to do some stuff if an object that has type `Loadable ..` is `Loaded result`, how can I do this without having many case statements?
I want to access this object (a record) and use all of it's items in the case that it is `Loaded` but there are too many items to just use a tuple. My current solution is to have a tuple of 3 of these items for each case statement but then I have 3 of the same case statements which is obviously not ideal. What's a better way to do this?; Yes but I'm not sure how a record would help here seeing as the object is already a record. Would I just have to make this record again since I'm trying to access its elements in a certain case of this object?
This is in my view function so I need to access all of the object's items in the case that it is `Loaded`.
One way I thought of doing it would be to create my own kind of `Maybe.andThen` or `Maybe.map` for my type `Loadable` but I just wanted to see if there was  a better way",1
6140_elmlangB_2018,Grant,"<@Alisha>, not sure this is answering your question, but you can write your own `map` function to operate on your `Loadable a` type; ```

6140_elmlangB_2018,Eldon,"I'm currently creating an app where I need to load a lot of things and then use them in main program once all have been loaded.

To keep main code simple I decided to have two separate types, `LoadingStuff` and `LoadedStuff`. Then I have a function `validate` which check that everything has been loaded and creates validated version for simpler access.
```
type alias LoadingStuff =
    { field: Loadable String
    , anotherField: Loadable String
    ...
    }

type alias LoadedStuff =
    { field: String
    , anotherField: String

6140_elmlangB_2018,Tiny,"If you want to be fancy you can create `map2` or `andMap` to allow you to combine arbitrary loading values together into a single loading value; e.g.
```
type alias User = { name : String, age : Int }

loadingUser : Loadable User
loadableUser =
  map2 User loadingName loadingAge
```",2
6140_elmlangB_2018,Phebe,"Another function your could write along with `map` that can help (because I was under the impression that you have to deal with multiple `Loadable` values at the same time) can be `andMap`:
```
andMap : Loadable (a -&gt; b) -&gt; Loadable a -&gt; Loadable b
andMap transformationOver loadable =
  case transformationOver of
    Loading -&gt; Loading
    LoadingError err -&gt; LoadingError err
    Loaded fn -&gt; map fn loadable
```
What you can do once you have `andMap` is apply a function that takes multiple `Loadable` and combine their values onces every one of the is `Loaded`, or fail with either the first `Loading` or `LoadingError` it finds, like this:
```
Loaded (\value1 value2 value3 -&gt; ...)
  |&gt; andMap loadable1
  |&gt; andMap loadable2
  |&gt; andMap loadable3

6140_elmlangB_2018,Tiny,`mapN` / `andMap` are probably my most used functions in Elm :heart:,0
6140_elmlangB_2018,Phebe,I'm partial to `andMap` myself (anything that allows me not to change the `N` every time I add or remove a field :wink:).,0
6140_elmlangB_2018,Eldon,"I think that `mapN` and record constructors are perhaps the worst functions in Elm, as those are tied to the record field order in their usually use case. I much prefer to be explicit:

loadableUser : Loadable User

        (\name age -&gt;
            { name = name, age = age }

6140_elmlangB_2018,Tiny,"I'm not sure `map2` is the culprit here? The issue is that `User` is easier to type than `(\name age -&gt; { name = name, age = age })`, especially for larger records",0
6140_elmlangB_2018,Eldon,Especially with larger records I'd never use the constructors.,0
6140_elmlangB_2018,Tiny,In practice I guess I often have custom constructors for my more complex records,0
6140_elmlangB_2018,Phebe,"Same here. Having custom constructors having another important benefit: hiding the implementation details behind its contract, allowing a cleaner refactor when said details need changing.",0
6140_elmlangB_2018,Alisha,"I'm not quite understanding how to use these functions. I don't see why I need a `map` because I'm not trying to perform anything on any of these values.

6140_elmlangB_2018,Tiny,Then you want a single case statement; In the branch for `Loaded` you have access to the record and can do whatever you need there,0
6140_elmlangB_2018,Alisha,So this is my hacky way of doing it now but I have more than 3 var's; Sorry I meant to say that this is all in a let statement. So how do I do this with more than 3 var's?,0

6140_elmlangB_2018,Tiny,"In situations like this, it's usually helpful to write most of your functions to act on data they can assume is already loaded; In the example above the `viewAddress` function renders an address to HTML and doesn't know anything about loading statuses; Then you write a single `case` statement to loadable values and handle the non-loaded cases; if the data is loaded you hand it off to your regular function; I recommend this approach a lot for working with `Maybe` (<https://robots.thoughtbot.com/problem-solving-with-maybe>, and <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43eM4kNbb6c>) but the principle applies more generally here too :slightly_smiling_face:; probably recursion (or recursive `andThen` if you're doing side effects like HTTP); A lot of looping problems can be expressed as lists you can fold or map over; not sure if you can do so here though :thinking_face:",0

2. Read from `.env`
2. Read from environment variables

3574_pythondev_2018,Aleida,<@Ayana> django and flask are actually pretty similar. I’d say it’s easier to start with django because it made a lot of decisions for you,0

3574_pythondev_2018,Aleida,Sure; Performance problems exist often because programmers forget to EXPLAIN queries and to create proper indexes,0

To me, pub/sub pattern seems like overly complicated solution for this kind of task, but whatever, it can get the work done. 

But what if I want to make it as reusable component, as a package? I'm not allowed to post this component to the package repo, because it has dependency on js library, and that is prohibited for distributed packages. In other words, if you are a library/framework/package developer, you cannot use *any* js library whatsoever (or any other library written in any other language)? In terms of language development as a whole, it is close to having no interop at all. 

I don't get it, because in the docs it is said several times how important it is to have good interop for new languages, and then elm has *this* kind of interop? Only pub/sub interface and no interop at all for reusable libs and frameworks? That is as far away from having ""good interop"" as I can imagine.

3315_elmlangG_2018,Harley,"`(Decode.succeed ""basic"")`",2
3315_elmlangG_2018,Thelma,With the basic json decode package or with decode pipeline? decode pipeline has the `hardcoded` function; with the basic decode package you don’t use pipelines,0

3315_elmlangG_2018,Thelma,"Ok, you want to check that a field has a certain value",0
3315_elmlangG_2018,Ta,"Yes!; My solution so far is creating something that parses constant strings:
```
decodeConstant : String -&gt; Decoder ()

and using that to decode something that is supposed to have a constant in it:
```Decode.succeed (\_ -&gt; Kinto.Basic)
     |&gt; Decode.field ""type"" (decodeConstant ""basic"")
     |&gt; Decode.required (Decode.field ""username"" Decode.string)

3793_elmlangG_2018,Nickolas,"Hi. I’m using the Svg library – specifically Svg.rect and Svg.line – to draw ASTs, but the ASTs differ a lot in size and I have trouble centering them on the screen. Currently I’ve hardcoded the x-value where I draw the root of the tree, and the children are drawn relatively to this. The root should be exactly in the middle of the screen/surrounding div, as the children are divided equally below it. Any tips to how I get the correct x-value to give to the root?

3793_elmlangG_2018,Anderson,"<@Nickolas> Is the SVG only for display inside a browser or do you need all the information inside the SVG? If you're inside a browser I'd suggest keeping your approach but start your x-value at zero to spread the tree left and right from the y axis and just use a CSS transform to translate the whole thing by +50% of the canvas width on the x-axis. If you need that all in SVG you already have to know how how wide the canvas is, so your approach seems pretty good to me. You can certainly achieve ""prettier"" results but you'd have to either restrict the node size (maybe having them all the the same width as the biggest node label) and have to make assumptions about the branch factor which in an AST might not be doable. Or you do nitty gritty layouting after the fact to find the x-value programmatically by walking the the tree bottom up, which seems like overkill to me.",2

664_clojurians_2017,Georgann,I don't really use Kafka without Kafka streams. But ksml is a clojure Kafka client. It lets you define a data flow topology in data and then compiles it down to the underlying java interop.,2

1344_clojurians_2017,Lenita,Java interop question: I would like to take the results of a datomic query and construct a java object with them. Rather than doing `(MyObj. (first result) (second result))` I would like to use apply to pass the arguments to the constructor of MyObj. However when I try to do that I get a compiler error. I'm guessing that just means that the . constructor is not actually a function. Is there a clean way to do this?,1
1344_clojurians_2017,Daniell,<@Lenita> The only thing that comes to mind is to write a Clojure wrapper for your constructor: `(defn my-obj [a b c d] (MyObj. a b c d))` or whatever you need and then you should be able to `(apply my-obj result)`,2
1344_clojurians_2017,Lenita,<@Daniell> i think i'll do the inline version of that `(apply #(MyObj. %1 %2 %3) results)` which is definitely less awkward than what I had before. thanks!; what is the best way to handle a function in a pipeline that expects the piped value as the first arg when all the others expect it as the last arg. Is there a nice way to use an anonymous function to do that?,0
1344_clojurians_2017,Terra,<@Lenita> you can use `as-&gt;` (<https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/as-%3E>) if functions expect the argument to be at different positions,0
1344_clojurians_2017,Lenita,<@Terra> thats awesome. thanks.,0
1344_clojurians_2017,Daniell,"<@Lenita> You can start with `-&gt;` and have a nested `-&gt;&gt;` for the ""last"" position and then your first position expression (and then another nested `-&gt;&gt;` if you need it).",0
1344_clojurians_2017,Lenita,<@Daniell> that seems like a good solution too. I like that with `as-&gt;` I can call out a name to help my readers follow the transformations through the pipeline.,0
1386_clojurians_2017,Danielle,how do i figure out out which version clojure has decided to call when doing interop.

What's the strategy used? i.e. is typehinting `Callable` not enough?,1
1386_clojurians_2017,Rebeca,"it depends, if the compiler can figure out that you are invoking the method on an Executor service, type hinting Callable is enough; if you use interop to construct an ExecutorService and bind it to a local and use that, the compiler can figure it out, if you create it as a global (via def) then it can't, but you can type hint the var if you want",2
1386_clojurians_2017,Danielle,what's really weird is we were trying the same JVM version inside docker and outside docker and we got different results w/ the same code,0
1386_clojurians_2017,Rebeca,sure; I would not be surprised at that,0
1386_clojurians_2017,Danielle,mind if i ask you to pick you brain to explain why you aren't surprised? :wink:,0
1386_clojurians_2017,Rebeca,"the executor issue is tricky because the class of the thing you are passing in, introduces more ambiguity instead of narrowing the scope; functions implement both Callable and Runnable, so it could be either",0
1386_clojurians_2017,Danielle,"aye, I think what we're going to do to reduce ambiguity is to reify a Callable",0
1386_clojurians_2017,Rebeca,"I think it is a little odd that you would get differences with just inside and outside of docker, but I am perfectly happy to hand wave that away as you also introducing some other difference",0
1386_clojurians_2017,Danielle,"yeah it's really weird, we've gotten inconsistencies in other ways as well (trying tests in this order):
- ran our test using lein test (on 2.7.2) and the right version of `.submit` was used

- ran our test using lein test (on 2.7.2) and the the wrong version of `.submit` was used &lt;-- freaky",0
1386_clojurians_2017,Rebeca,"the version of lein has nothing to do with it; (well, has less to do with it then you might think); the important thing would be the build of the jvm (version and os) and the clojure version (which lein version might effect); e.g. if you are locally running on the jvm on osx, and comparing it to the jvm on linux in docker, many (not often noticeable) things will be different",0

1449_clojurians_2017,Anneliese,any recommendations of mocking libraries ??,1
1449_clojurians_2017,Guillermo,clojure folks tend to avoid mocking,2
1449_clojurians_2017,Mia,"depends on the features you need, but we (CircleCI) use <https://github.com/circleci/bond>",2
1449_clojurians_2017,Guillermo,I have had good success in the past with making protocols that represent external side-effects (e.g. a mail server) and then reifying dummy impls.,0
1449_clojurians_2017,Mia,very simple and light,0
1449_clojurians_2017,Anneliese,<@Guillermo> but how can i test a function that depends on another one that calls external systems or has side effect; <@Guillermo> I got your point,0
1449_clojurians_2017,Guillermo,"if you feel the need to mock, you might have a global that needs to be an argument.",0
1449_clojurians_2017,Mia,^^ that’s an awesome way to think about it,0
1449_clojurians_2017,Guillermo,(I'm speaking in vast generalities),0
1449_clojurians_2017,Margaret,"ideally the external functionality has a thin wrapper that you can easily cover with integration tests, and you can pass in an alternate stub implementation for testing things that use it; (I think this expands on what ghadi was saying); sometimes it’s even worth making a protocol, in order to have two implementations (the stub and the one that uses some external / stateful / side effecting resource)",0
1449_clojurians_2017,Guillermo,"If you're using Ring or similar, you can make a middleware that inserts the appropriate implementation into the request context, that way you don't have to grab it from a global var",0
1449_clojurians_2017,Anneliese,<@Margaret> <@Guillermo> I got the point but I really don't know why we should avoid mocks? aren't they easier than stubing protocols?,0
1449_clojurians_2017,Margaret,"they lead to unneeded complexity, you end up wrangling an implicit global state in order to verify something that shouldn’t care about it; with-redefs for example causes a multitude of problems, including preventing parallel testing; if you really want the easier / global / implicit thing, at least implement it in terms of something that uses an explicit argument to the function - you can easily build implicit / global / stateful out of explicit immutable arguments, but it is much harder to go the other way",0
1449_clojurians_2017,Anneliese,valid point but this will add too many types and records which i try to avoid most of the time,0
1449_clojurians_2017,Margaret,"you can do it without a protocol or record - I only mention using a protocol (which in my practice means using a reify in the test, and either a record or reify in the implementation) - because that can simplify the swapping of implementations; if you prefer functions, use functions, it does work",0
1449_clojurians_2017,Anneliese,<@Margaret> thnx,0
1449_clojurians_2017,Ed,"Standard environment. Yeah, it takes a little bit, but it's a lot easier now that there are no restrictions on what classes to use. Let me know if you have specific questions and if there's interest, I might publish it as a lein plugin.",0

1637_clojurians_2017,Jone,Can anyone recommend a Clojure library for calling into an external C library?,1
1637_clojurians_2017,Sonny,Clojure can use Java JNI to call native code,2
1637_clojurians_2017,Sandy,"<@Jone> I'd recommend JNA, it's super seamless with Clojure; (.invoke (Library/getFunction ""libc"" ""sin"") [0.42]); That's about the extent of the psudeocode you need with JNA",2
1637_clojurians_2017,Weston,"jni is much faster tho (last time I used it, few years back)",0
1637_clojurians_2017,Sandy,"<@Weston> define ""much faster"" :slightly_smiling_face:",0
1637_clojurians_2017,Weston,"in my case it was an order of magnitude faster; I was interacting with a lib related to rf cavity simulation, so quite fast internally",0
1637_clojurians_2017,Sandy,"As always the problem is:
* JNA gives you almost instant access to C libs a a slight perf cost (we're talking about 10x slower over the cost of a function call, that's not much)
* JNI gives you near native function call speeds, but you have to write/generate/maintain a wrapper and all the associated build code",0
1637_clojurians_2017,Weston,"but jni requires more ceremony for sure, I had to write some java on the side and then call from clojure; exactly as you said; not sure what you mean about the build code, a simple lein file was good enough, I had the java wrapper and the clojure code living in the same project, with the .dll (windows... *sigh*) in question (I guess it works the same with .so files)",0
1637_clojurians_2017,Jone,"<@Sonny> Thank you. I was hoping for a more painless way though as I am going to use a C/C++ library with a lot of functions. I already started wrapping it in C, Java and Clojure but it is not much fun.
<@Sandy> Thank you for the suggestion. I guess that is as good as it gets right now in the general case. Could not find any maintained pure Clojure libraries. I am actually the author of clj-native and the bits in Leiningen that link native libraries into projects. But I abandoned that years ago because I stopped doing Clojure development and now I don’t like that declarative approach any more so I am not going to revive it.

1841_clojurians_2017,Sandy,Kafka is probably the easiest since it’s immutable,0

1841_clojurians_2017,Particia,"<@Twanna> funny just opened the slack now as i was just doing some coding on this. Spent few hrs today reading through the code, but in terms of alt i still cant figure out how the handler fn callback on take! is NOT called (or is kinda rolled back) for the channels that do not end up first (in the race condition). I have done this kinda implementation few times in past, but alt i always coded myself because of this. I originally thought the mutex between channels is shared, but it does not seem so; the alt-flag locking also does not seem to do the job.... <@Sandy> if there is no available library but you still could point me to the right namespace and line of code that addresses this that would be very much appreciated ... i should be (edit: hopefully) able to figure out the rest....",2

1841_clojurians_2017,Sandy,"<@Particia> I would recommend thinking about the relationship between the queue and the channels. What do you want to happen if a message is 3 channels deep into your app and the service dies?; What I recommend is instead passing an ack funtion with the message, and then the last thread In your channel chain calls that to tell the queue that the message ha been processed ; In short, it’s a mistake to ack the message when it goes onto a channel.

9_clojurians_2019,Alix,"I'm confused about when to use what style of namespaced keys. I know how they work, I just don't know what is best from a maintainability standpoint. For example is `:user/email` a good namespaced key? Or should it be namespaced to the company such as `com.company.user/email`? Or perhaps namespaced to the project `com.company.project.user/email` or even a project file namespace such as `com.company.project.spec.user/email`. Should any way be used exclusively, or are there use cases where either style might be used? I'm thinking that `:user/email` still might result in naming collisions if two systems deal with `user` in a different way. I'm hoping to figure out an optimal solution for systems spanning many projects in an organisation.; I think I remember a Rich Hickey talk on this but I don't remember which one",1
9_clojurians_2019,Rosaline,"project level is pretty good, I don't care very much for using the names of code namespaces for keyword namespaces; I think a good rule of thumb is to imagine all your data that exists in memory exists in a sql database, the namespaces would be the table names and the names would be the column names; and then imagine everyone's data is in the same global table space, and what would you need to name your tables to avoid collisions",2
9_clojurians_2019,Alix,"When you say everyone's data, are you referring to company level namespace like `com.company.user/email`?",0
9_clojurians_2019,Rosaline,"that would be one possible solution to that, prefixing all your table names with some string that you ""own""; another solution would be using uuids, which would work but are not very friendly",0
9_clojurians_2019,Celestine,"Another factor to consider <@Alix> is how ""global"" your data is going to be. Is this just a map of data that will exist inside your company? Inside just this project? How unique does the name need to be?; If you produce it from a library you put out there for everyone to use, it needs to be ""more unique"" so that it can't conflict with any similar data used by any of the users of your library.",2
9_clojurians_2019,Madeleine,And the issue was that it coupled our key names with the namespace; So I'd say be careful about that,0
9_clojurians_2019,Alix,"Right so it looks like there is no real convention around this. And I should just go with what makes the most sense given the factors.; Some examples:
If I need a db uri for my users db in my company I could namespace like this `:db.users/uri`. I wouldn't want to use `:db/uri` as I might have many databases in my company. I also didn't namespace to the company because this key will be accessed only within the company
And I could use `:user/email` if users in my company are global among all projects. But if my company had two products I would namespace the user attributes accordingly such as `:project1.user/email` &amp; `:project2.user/email` but only if some of the code was shared in any way.; That's where my thinking is after considering the feedback; <@Otelia> If there was 2 databases for users (employees, clients) then the business logic for dealing with the two types of users would probably be different. And the data is stored is two different places. To me this because of the 2 datasources, I would think to namespace to two separate namespaces. The namespace gives me the ability to inspect my data and decide if I want to do something with a client or an employee. And I can tell the difference because of the namespace. If there was no difference, then there would be no reason to store client &amp; employee separately or differently (with some technical exceptions such as security). Because they're essentially the same I would namespace them the same. I'm still working all this out but that's my thinking.; Yea that's something I've though about also. For example the namespaces seem redundant for this data structure `{:orgs [{:org/employees [{:employee/paychecks [{:paycheck/id 1}]}]}]}` because each level up contains the context. Perhaps the namespace allows you to avoid passing in the context or more information than that is needed. For a paycheck/id=1 instead of giving `{:employee/paychecks [{:paycheck/id 1}`, you just give `{:paycheck/id 1}` and the namespace allows you to determine the context.",0
9_clojurians_2019,Otelia,I think you must be right.; But it would be interesting to know what specific benefits others have found for the unique keywords.,0
9_clojurians_2019,Alix,Yea I'd like to know also. I've never written code like and I'd like to know if others how found it practical for production use; The most practical scenarios I can think of is dynamic spec validation. It could just lookup the spec for all its keys and avoid knowing any context apart from the keys; I've never done that though so I'm not sure how if at all it would work; Or even if it's a good idea. I feel like you would want to explicitly specify what spec you're validating against,0
9_clojurians_2019,Otelia,"OTOH, a spec for :person/email would probably work for email addresses in all tables.",0
9_clojurians_2019,Alix,"However you could still do that with unique keys and some mapping.; But your thinking raises another question for me. So far I've assumed that the namespace of keys in a map would be the same. Are there any use cases for them to be different? Perhaps what your suggesting might also be a correct way of doing this. `{:person/id ""123"" :person/name ""Caleb"" :employee/number ""001""}`; As long as there would be no way that the information stored in the shared keys would need to be handled differently I would think",0
9_clojurians_2019,Otelia,"Yes, I've wondered about that. But I don't have enough experience in Clojure to say. Someone with more experience will probably chime in. I can admit that unique keywords give you the most flexibility for treating them differently, if necessary, just don't know specifically when it's necessary.",0
9_clojurians_2019,Alix,Yea I agree. How far is too far. Perhaps there are times when you would use them and times when you wouldn't.,0
9_clojurians_2019,Celestine,"When you're looking at nested data structures, remember that sometimes you'll just be passing part of it around -- so you don't always have the parental context.; Qualified keys are designed to ""avoid conflicts"" and to ""uniquely identify an entity in a given context"". So they really are about _context_.; For example, at work, we have a billing subsystem and we generally have all the keys in maps associated with billing qualified with `wsbilling`. The context we need to convey is that ""this data all belongs to billing"", so the maps within that system tend to have keys like `:wsbilling/member-id`, `:wsbilling/initial-amount` and so on -- unique within the context of billing and the systems that it interacts with.; Another part of the system deals with multiple ""layers"" of domain logic so it uses qualifiers that identify the different layers.",0
9_clojurians_2019,Alix,"Right that makes sense. And expanding upon mixing namespaces in a map as I previously suggested. Looking back on work with datomic, your entities wouldn't contain maps with mixed namespaced keys. They would nest them under a ref.",0
9_clojurians_2019,Celestine,"Some of these qualifiers match actual namespaces, some don't.",0
9_clojurians_2019,Alix,So perhaps the second nesting would be better than mixing namespaces,0
9_clojurians_2019,Celestine,"The idea is you use whatever qualifiers make sense for your data in your context. Making these ""as unique as they need to be"".",0
9_clojurians_2019,Alix,<@Celestine> And would the use of qualifiers matching actual namespaces be almost exclusively used for keywords private to the namespace? Are there other reasons you might do this?,0
9_clojurians_2019,Celestine,(which is why there are no specific rules of thumb about this whole thing :slightly_smiling_face: ),0
9_clojurians_2019,Alix,Yea Clojure is very interesting in that regard. It's like the complete opposite of something opinionated like ruby on rails. Everyone sort of does what works for them. It does make it a little difficult if you're new however as its hard to copy what other people do because everyone does it so differently. I imagine it's an experienced developers dream though as they can do everything exactly how they like it.,0
9_clojurians_2019,Celestine,"It means you need to understand more of the abstractions and concepts, yes.",0
9_clojurians_2019,Nova,"<@Alix> It's more so that people program with abstractions, and the concrete code that comes out varies",0
9_clojurians_2019,Otelia,"Thanks Sean, I see your point about nested data structures. And it is good to know that there is no standard convention.
Another question: If you have both :employee/email and :client/email, don't you sometimes want to treat all emails the same or similarly, and in that case do you use the keyword name to identify it as an email? Just curious if you'd encountered that situation.",0
9_clojurians_2019,Alix,<@Nova> That blows my mind a little bit. When deciding on how to implement something I've usually started by figuring out what worked for me in the past or finding out what other people have done. Pretty much just lots of practice. Perhaps to improve myself I should spend some more time reading up on the theory.,0
9_clojurians_2019,Nova,"<@Alix> It's not so much about theory, as much as it's about understanding 'what needs to happen'",0
9_clojurians_2019,Celestine,"<@Otelia> If you've named them `:employee/email` and `:client/email` it'll generally be because you want to be able to tell them apart in a particular context. If you want to do something email-generic, you can pass either value to a function that just takes ""an email address"" or you can construct a new map containing the bits you might want under more generic names.; When you get into specs, you also have to consider whether these fields have the same underlying spec or not.",0
9_clojurians_2019,Nova,"<@Alix> I find that when programming in Lisps, especially clojure, I rarely need to think about writing code. I spend most of my time thinking about architecture or specification. I find this also leads to better applications.",0
9_clojurians_2019,Celestine,"For example, your spec for `:employee/email` might be a regex that has a fixed `@` domain name part (for your company).; <@Alix> Clojure certainly rewards thinking at a higher level of abstraction a lot of the time... and can punish thinking at a lower level sometimes :slightly_smiling_face:",0
9_clojurians_2019,Nova,"<@Celestine> I feel like that's a bit unfair, because the flexibility of the language allows you to do far-reaching optimizations with lower-level code changes. Perhaps more accurate to say that Clojure punishes premature optimization more than other languages?",0
9_clojurians_2019,Otelia,"My takeaway from this conversation is that I am free to use keyword namespaces for whatever purpose is most suited to my app, which turns the focus back to the app data model. It's a nice freedom. Thanks everyone for the comments and help.",0
9_clojurians_2019,Alix,Likewise thank you for the help,0
9_clojurians_2019,Celestine,"<@Nova> OK, yeah, that's what I was reaching for really.; But also if you try to dive in and think about problems the way you might in other languages -- where mutable variables and loops are the basic building blocks -- you'll find Clojure working against you.; So you often have to step back and think in terms of collections rather than elements, and abstractions rather than implementation, in order to get the ""shape"" of a Clojure solution.",0

119_clojurians_2019,Reiko,"I don't agree with that as ""not guaranteed to be stable"" is ambiguous. It is not stating that is or isn't stable, which was Dan's original question. If the documentation were to state that it is ""Stable, but not guaranteed"" now it's not ambiguous.; I think it would be helpful if we had an explanation on why it may not be stable in the future",0
119_clojurians_2019,Celestine,"I'm answering this as someone who spent nearly a decade working on ANSI/ISO standards committees. Saying ""Stable, but not guaranteed"" is not useful. Saying ""Not guaranteed to be stable"" provides more useful information.; (because it makes it clear that the stability of the current implementation is just an implementation detail and not part of the contract)",0
119_clojurians_2019,Reiko,"Please explain to me how something that is ambiguous is more useful than something that is not ambiguous; The documentation should reflect the current behavior.

119_clojurians_2019,Celestine,"Stability of a sort is either part of the contract or part of the implementation. You need to know whether it is part of the contract. Either it is intended to be stable or it is not. That is true across Clojure's APIs in general -- if the implementation happens to provide ""more"" than the docstring, what's in the docstring is all you can rely on.; In this case, the docstring provides no guidance (although it _does not guarantee stability_ today so it's actually just fine as it is).",0
119_clojurians_2019,Reiko,That may or may not be meaningful. Clojure libraries have a tendency to be completed for their stated objective(s) and haven't needed to change anything since then.,0
119_clojurians_2019,Celestine,"If a Clojure docstring provides a guarantee, that is considered when changes are made in the future -- because the core team have a principle of not breaking guaranteed behavior.; If the docstring provides no guarantee, behavior _can_ change without needing to update the documentation (since the behavior was never guaranteed).; It's a courtesy for the docstring to be explicit about not guaranteeing a specific behavior. That's kind of Clojure's basic position on a lot of things.",0
119_clojurians_2019,Harriet,I am aware of that. However in this specific case Spark is already at 2.4 and the libs are in 2.1,0

119_clojurians_2019,Tammera,"huh, googles impl of stableSort is actually quite interesting. Expected an actual stable sort algorithm, but instead they change the comparator to also take index into account.; So it gains `2n` extra time complexity for looping the array twice to add/remove indices, and `n` memory for the array of value/index pairs that is actually sorted",0
119_clojurians_2019,Celestine,"Right, and if the decision is to _guarantee a stable sort_ -- as the Clojure docstring does -- then updating the (ClojureScript) docstring to make that same guarantee _about current *and* future behavior_ would be the correct thing to do.; You're missing my point that if there is no intended guarantee of that behavior, then the current docstring is accurate: it _makes no guarantee_ about stability.; Clojure's docstrings are generally very careful about what they do and don't guarantee. If they guarantee something, it is a contract that can be relied on and will not break in the future (because Rich says breakage is bad).; If a docstring does not guarantee a specific behavior, then that behavior can change (because it wasn't part of the contract).; Does that make what I'm saying clearer?",0
119_clojurians_2019,Tammera,"(Maybe put it like this, that it _uses_ stable sort is an implementation detail, it could as well use quicksort, which is not stable, but that wouldn’t matter as the stability is not required by the contract between caller (you calling sort) and the callee (cljs’s sort))",0

I don't believe my point is being understood, which is that the Clojure version is guaranteed stable and there is no reason that can't be true of the ClojureScript version as the function it is using is guaranteed to be stable. The goog.array library could disappear off of the face of the Earth and we'd still be fine because we could recreate the implementation as it is open source and relies only on essential JS operations that aren't going to change.

348_clojurians_2019,Jonah,"Hi, I have a question about `defmulti` and `defmethod` in different namespaces. It seems that if you use `defmethod` in a separate namespace from `defmulti` then something in your app has to require this namespace, so `defmethod` actually runs. Is this true? And if yes, is there a best practice to avoid circular dependency in this case? Can't find the answer in docs or somewhere else...",1
348_clojurians_2019,Tammera,Yeah I believe all ns’es that define `defmethod`s for a `defmulti` must be `require`d for the branches of the multi to be available,2
348_clojurians_2019,Jonah,"It does work when you require ""branch-namespaces"" but you can't require them from the namespace where `defmulti` is, due to a circular dependency. Requiring them elsewhere creates an implicit dependency that will eventually break with some changes.; Kinda puzzled how to overcome this.",0
348_clojurians_2019,Tammera,"Right, why do you want to use the `defmethod` that you are dynamically extending in the namespace that you are defining it in; could you maybe resolve that",0
348_clojurians_2019,Jonah,"I have few text formats that I serialize/deserialize to the filesystem. They aren't all defined at this point and will evolve as an application evolves. So, my idea was to define multimethod for every operation and implement it for each format in the separate namespace.",0
348_clojurians_2019,Tammera,"right, I am not challenging the use of a multimethod. What I think what could resolve your circular dependency is moving the _definition_ of the multimethod away from its _use_.",0
348_clojurians_2019,Jonah,"Yes, but then namespace where I _use_ the multimethod has to require both the definition and the implementation namespaces?; or am I missing something?",0
348_clojurians_2019,Becki,"i don't think that's actually true. the namespace needs to require the `defmulti` ns but it does not need to require the ns where the `defmethod` is defined. That namespace has to have been required already, but not necessarily here.",0
348_clojurians_2019,Tammera,"^right, that is true, thanks for that clarification",0
348_clojurians_2019,Becki,so you could require all of the implementing namespaces in your start up and be assured that they are all ready to go,0
348_clojurians_2019,Jonah,"that will solve the problem, I'm just concerned that later someone can remove this ""require"" because they won't be explicitly used in startup namespace.; That what I meant by implicit dependency.",0
348_clojurians_2019,Tammera,"Also, I think my suggestion would work, I would have a ns `use` that depends on the namespace `define` + all namespaces `extend`, where each `extend` namespace depends on `define`. I don’t think there is a circular dependency there, but I am lacking some paper to draw it out ^^",0

380_clojurians_2019,Dann,"well, there are no protocols or methods there; (there are protocols and methods in the implementation of the object passed to swap!, and swap! itself is an object extending IFn but I don't think that's what you mean); but if you mean generally, you want to do an AOP style wrapping of an existing function, yeah that's what it typically looks like; though idiomatically `wrap-foo` means ""hand this thing a function, it returns a new one"", which isn't your semantics here, but that's a naming issue",2
380_clojurians_2019,Arnoldo,"poor choice of nomenclature on my part... I basically just mean if I have a type that implements a protocol, and I want to do something extra with one or all of the functions implementing the protocol on that type, is that the best way; yeah i named it `wrap` but it's more a passthrough method, agree on the naming",0

380_clojurians_2019,Arnoldo,"i didn't literally mean method, sorry... ""passthrough methods"" is just naming convention for functions (or methods in other languages) that do nothing but delegate to another function",0
380_clojurians_2019,Dann,"sure, most AOP style wrappers will take the original function and then use apply with a variable arg list like in your code; more commonly the function itself is passed as one of the args, which makes the wrapper more reusable (one reason functions are more flexible than methods); <@Arnoldo> this is also visible in the signature of `swap!` itself, and `alter-var-root` - the function signatures make it easy to pass in a function that exists already, and return an ""enhanced"" version",0
380_clojurians_2019,Arnoldo,I noticed that actually...,0

682_clojurians_2018,Shawanda,"the spec does specify a way of tracking individual tokens with the `jti` claim; so you can definitely build a blacklist that lasts until the token expires; if you have that security need; JWTs are not a good fit for mutable session state, but they are great for authentication; and authorization if you construct them with whatever claims you need signed into the payload",0
682_clojurians_2018,Olene,<@Divina> now I see that article addresses that somewhat - but keeping a blacklist of expired tokens (or whitelist of good ones) is much simpler than a generalized distributed session,0

3345_clojurians_2018,Saundra,"I have a sort of philosophical question on why a function is a particular way…
I like using `keep` where applicable. It’s effectively `(remove nil? (map ...))` but it’s a little more terse. The annoying thing though is that it doesn’t support multiple arities like `map` does, so I sometimes end up needing the `remove/map` idiom anyway. I’m wondering if there is a reason why it wasn’t extended to support multiple seqs like `map` does, or if it’s just a matter of lack of the motivation to write it?
This made me also look at the source for `map`, by way of comparison to the source for `keep`. Like `keep` there is an effort to make it as efficient as possible, using chunked seqs (makes sense, since `map`s are used a lot). However, the longer arity versions just use a lazy-seq with a simple `cons`. Was this just a matter of code-writing expediency, since these arities are used less frequently? Does complexity of some other operation overtake the benefits of chunking? Or is there some other reason that chunking isn’t used for these?",0
3345_clojurians_2018,Brendon,"<@Saundra> Not sure about most of your questions, but have you considered just using `mapcat`, which does support multiple collections?",0
3345_clojurians_2018,Saundra,"I use `mapcat` where appropriate, but I don’t see how it offers functionality in this context?
My questions are:
- Is there a reason why `keep` does not have arities supporting multiple seq? (If not, then I might try writing them)
- Is there a reason why `map` only does chunking when processing a single seq? (If not, then I might try updating the arities for multiple seqs to also support chunking); OK, that makes sense. But my original perspective here was to make code more terse (`keep` vs. `map`) and optimized (chunked vs. unchunked).
`mapcat` chunks its answers, so that does handle part of it, but the seq wrapping of intermediate values before being returned lazily makes me think it would be losing something that `map` offers?; I’ve used transducers in various circumstances. I’m particularly enamored of the case where individual elements in a stream result in 0..n output elements, and being able to terminate streams early. But I never really felt like I completely understood the benefits of transducers in general. I can, and have, used them just fine. But since things like an applied `map` or `filter` are lazy, I never felt like composing transducers for these would have significantly different overhead to just threading through multiple seq processing operations.
<@Leonia> in an effort to drink more Kool-Aid, outside of the cases where transducers offer functionality that’s not easily supported with standard seq processing functions, do you have a link which describes the _*why*_ of transducers? (as opposed to the numerous pages which show _*how*_)",0

3545_clojurians_2018,Andy,It’s a good snippet.; In general there isn’t one for several reasons. For instance Java object serialization only gets you so far when you have to deal with closing over instance objects.

732_elmlangB_2017,Rema,"I have a type with a tag that takes 2 parameters `type MyType = MyType arg1 arg2`.

However, when I need to nest the type inside another type `MyWidget (MyType arg1 arg2)`, I cannot use `&gt;&gt;` like I would usually do when nesting types `myFunction (MyType &gt;&gt; MyWidget)`, as MyType takes 2 arguments, and function composition `&gt;&gt;` only deals with one parameter. What's the usual way to design this in an elegant way? I've tried with an anonymous function, but it's ugly.

That's when `map`, `map2`, and `andThen` ""clicked"" for me; then I realized I could reuse the same concepts pretty much everywhere else in Elm.

1126_elmlangB_2017,Carina,"I'd like to subscribe to a websocket, and whenever I get a message, I also get the current date with it, what's the best practice for this?
I first wanted to ""chain"" tasks, with the Task.andThen function, but the websocket provides a Subscription which can't be chained.
I could subscribe to the current time and store it in the model, then use that value. This would play well with the json decoder used to decode the message in the subscription as the it needs the current time. But that feels wasteful.
In short, is there a better way to ""chain"" a subscription with a something returning the current time?",1
1126_elmlangB_2017,Joey,"That sounds like a pretty decent way to go. Like `Cmd`'s, `Sub`'s can't be chained. One alternative is splitting the handling of the message in two - one where you receive the subscription's value, and start a task to get the current time and enrich the message with that, and then a second one that receives the original message and the current time.

1131_elmlangB_2017,Lyndsey,the `Time.DateTime` module has utilities for comparing dates.; The main issue with the official one is that the date constructed by Date.fromString is in UTC and you can have weird bugs introduced by the timezone.,0
1131_elmlangB_2017,Paige,Thanks I will check that one out when I decode them properly.,0
1131_elmlangB_2017,Lyndsey,"the format you presented is very close to ISO8601; and `Time.DateTime.fromISO8601` could be used if you convert your format to the ISO one; it has a `T` instead of the space between the date and the time and ends with a `Z`; ```""2017-06-02 09:34:22""++""Z"" |&gt; String.words |&gt; String.join ""T""```",0

It's a ""bag of effects"", really. These instructions may or may not result in a value being produced somewhere, for example outgoing ports don't result in a message, but also changing the url through `Navigation.newUrl`, as anohter example.; Furthermore, they do not have any ordering guarantees; These properties make it so you cannot compose them - you can't say `get the time, then make this http request, and then multiple every entry in the result with the current time` for example, unless you do multiple roundtrips; Tasks, on the other hand, describe a computation. They are sequential in nature, and every task _must_ either produce a value or fail with an error. These properties make them so you can compose them using `map`, `map2`(etc), `andThen`, `onError`, etc; However, since the only way to tell the runtime to do anything is to give it a command, you have to convert a task to a command first, using `Task.attempt` (for a task that could potentially fail) or `Task.perform` if you have a task which can simple never fail (like `Time.now`)",0
1803_elmlangB_2017,Barbra,"<@Joey> we use Tasks as a ""container "" for future commands?",0
1803_elmlangB_2017,Joey,"That's one way of thinking of them, yeah. They describe a single ""task"", which may involve multiple steps.; whereas a `Cmd msg` is a bag - you can use `Cmd.batch` to arbitrarily add commands to that bag, before passing it to the runtime (by returning it from `update`)",0
1803_elmlangB_2017,Sulema,"<@Joey> I'm reimplementing exchange rate comparator. My model is current exchange rates, an amount to exchange, list with results. The results are recalculated when I change amount OR when new exchange rates will come OR maybe something else in future
So for example in ChangeAmount update I wanted to put Cmd/Task/whatever which will recalculate results after this update. But I stuck on that I didn't know how to implement Cmd or Task. I ended up doing it in ""1. Cmd Msg* is inefficient"" way from linked article",0
1803_elmlangB_2017,Barbra,<@Joey> thank you very much for your help and explanation. But I still feel like I need read more about this topic. :(,0
1803_elmlangB_2017,Joey,<@Sulema> so make a function `recalculate` and call that in both branches?,0
1803_elmlangB_2017,Sulema,"I did it :smile:; <@Joey> my previous project was in redux-saga, where I could listen for that actions (change amount, change rates) in one function",0
1803_elmlangB_2017,Joey,"Right, cool. That's really the best way to do this. The way to abstract things in a functional language is to put it in a function, not to force a roundtrip :slightly_smiling_face:",0
1803_elmlangB_2017,Sulema,it was less to write. but of course hard to debug :smile:,0
1803_elmlangB_2017,Joey,"Yeah, sure, but that's basically also what you do in Elm. It's a little more explicit in elm, sure, but essentially `update` can just dispatch calls to functions, based on what message it receives and the state of the current model",0

1903_elmlangB_2017,Thomasina,What strategy do you guys and gals use when passing around the model to different views?,1
1903_elmlangB_2017,Fern,"<@Thomasina> `view : {m | partOfModel : Part, moreOfIt : String} -&gt; Html Msg`",2
1903_elmlangB_2017,Londa,<@Thomasina> Usually just pass the required fields as separate args,2
1903_elmlangB_2017,Fern,or that; `view model.allYaNeedForThisView model.andThis model.andThat`.. if it starts to get to long change to records,2
1903_elmlangB_2017,Londa,"I typically have some nested data that has the fetched page data, so separate args helps reduce the boilerplate from nesting",0
1903_elmlangB_2017,Thomasina,"Not only that, the parent functions shouldn't know what data the child needs imo; I still feel guilty passing a global variable around and passing only the specific part the view needs doesn't feel right either",0
1903_elmlangB_2017,Londa,I mean you just have to pick a point on the spectrum of where you stop passing around the global model,0
1903_elmlangB_2017,Thomasina,Maybe the module can expose a selector function that the parent function will call; that will map the model to include only needed data,0
1903_elmlangB_2017,Joey,"<@Thomasina> a parent function should absolutely know what data the child ""needs"". Or rather, it decides which data to pass to the child. They're just functions; you pass them data to operator on",0
1903_elmlangB_2017,Londa,Seems pretty close to just passing the global model &amp; doing that in a `let ... in ...`,0
1903_elmlangB_2017,Joey,"alternatively, if you feel strongly about this, you can check out `elm-disco`, though I personally think passing functions the data they need makes a lot more sense",0
1903_elmlangB_2017,Thomasina,"You don't care about the return value of the view function, you just want to display a UI element, that's why I think that although views are just functions they shouldn't be treated as such",0
1903_elmlangB_2017,Londa,"Hmm... I care about the return value of my views... that's why I call them in the first place :stuck_out_tongue:; Like if you think of your main view as generating a tree, you're calling the sub-views to use the returned values to build parts of the tree",0
1903_elmlangB_2017,Thomasina,"As I said that's just technicalities, the views are a description of the ui elements you want to see on the screen, they are hardly ""data""",0

2621_elmlangB_2017,Dorinda,"<@Leslie> there is a `view` function that receive the model as a parameter, multiple views are just that function calling other functions; Data for those views are just fields from the model passed as parameters to those functions",2

3383_elmlangB_2017,Pierre,I'll add that to the required reading list.,0
3383_elmlangB_2017,Lilian,<@Aldo> You can still use your SPA without hash-based navigation. You just have to configure your server to always serve your app regardless of route. ; They are having a conversation about that in <#C0CJ3SBBM|general> right now.,0
3383_elmlangB_2017,Burma,not really; You could say: `type Value = AString String | AFloat Float`; basically saying a `Value` is a wrapper around either a string or a float,0
3383_elmlangB_2017,Allena,"Yep, I know, thank you a lot); it is really unhandy in some cases; I am working on a DSL and I wanted to have a function which accepts String or Param String, but due to this limitation I have to make something line Flat String | Param String",0
3383_elmlangB_2017,Raymundo,"if you could do `type Value = String | Float` in elm, how would you go about getting the actual value out?; honestly asking, because i’m not particularly familiar with typescript; fn : Value -&gt; Something
fn v =
??? what do you do with v here",0
3383_elmlangB_2017,Allena,"There is no proper pattern matching at TS, so you just do if statement and type system automatically cast it. But I think in scala you can do something line v : String =&gt; /* do you shit */",0
3383_elmlangB_2017,Jodee,"so in scala : v match { case x : String =&gt; do something with x that now is string
case x : Float =&gt; do something with x that now is float",0
3383_elmlangB_2017,Allena,yep,0
3383_elmlangB_2017,Raymundo,ah interesting,0
3383_elmlangB_2017,Jodee,"in js/ts you would just check type - ""typeof"" -&gt; <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/typeof>",0
3383_elmlangB_2017,Raymundo,"yeah, i was more interested in the fp equivalent… i didn’t realize pattern matches in scala/haskell could typecheck like that; pretty neat",0
3383_elmlangB_2017,Jodee,"the thing is that in other FP langs; its ok to say: type X = String | Int; then type X is just a string or an int :slightly_smiling_face:; but that requires ofcourse pattern matching on type; hope they will do this in elm at some point .. like: case x of
v : String -&gt; ...",0
3383_elmlangB_2017,Allena,"TS has some kind of pattern matching fussed in if statement, it is quite strange, but works",0
3383_elmlangB_2017,Raymundo,"i’m hacking away on some scala right now, and i had no idea this was a feature that was available to me :smile:; scala is… not a small language :stuck_out_tongue:",0
3383_elmlangB_2017,Allena,"scala 3+ should have a lot of tricks; I haven't use it myself, but based on stuff they publishes in seems to have quite advanced algebraic data types system.; Anyway, thanks guys!!!",0
3383_elmlangB_2017,Jodee,in scala 3 you CAN actually just write : def func( x : Int | String) :slightly_smiling_face:; and also you can write def func( x : Int &amp; String ); so that x must be both int and string; etc,0
3383_elmlangB_2017,Allena,"yep, like ts",0
3383_elmlangB_2017,Raymundo,"very cool… so glad i jumped in to this thread; mind-expanding :smile:; i’m going to reformulate my question from above to see if anyone has any insights… if i have a record `{ name : String, alias : String, age: Int }` and I want to add a field `country: Country` to it, is there any way to do this without re-typing and re-assigning all of the existing fields?; i want to end up with `{ name : String, alias : String, age : Int, country : Country }`",0
3383_elmlangB_2017,Willena,It won’t be the same type,0
3383_elmlangB_2017,Raymundo,"indeed, i don’t want it to be",0
3383_elmlangB_2017,Willena,"If you want varying keys, you’ll need to use a `Dict`",0
3383_elmlangB_2017,Raymundo,i want it to be a new type with an additional field; they aren’t varying… the keys are well defined,0
3383_elmlangB_2017,Willena,"You can do something like
`{ name: original.name, alias: original.alias, country: newCountry}`",0
3383_elmlangB_2017,Allena,"hm, guys what do you think about possibility to write some back-end code in elm. I know that the leaders of community have negative opinion on it, but i don't think that it is bad idea in general, it might be nice way to write a small isomorphic apps. what do you think?",0
3383_elmlangB_2017,Willena,"If these are really additional, you could do something like
`{ data: original, country: newCountry}`",0
3383_elmlangB_2017,Raymundo,"yeah, you used to be able to do…
```
user = { name : ""Michael"" }
withAge = { name | age = 31 }
withCountry = { withAge | country = USA }
```; but i guess that’s gone now, and there’s no way to do it without lots of typing",0
3383_elmlangB_2017,Willena,"Well, you can sort of do that. Although using extensible records when constructing is not really recommend.; ```type alias user = { name : String }
type alias withAge a = { a | age : Int }
type alias withCountry a = { a | country : String }
type alias allOfThem = withAge (withCountry user)
```",0
3383_elmlangB_2017,Raymundo,i was hoping to not alias all of these types… they work well anonymously; except that it’s painful to make larger versions with additional fields,0
3383_elmlangB_2017,Willena,It might be a case where you want something like `Maybe`,0
3383_elmlangB_2017,Raymundo,from existing data,0
3383_elmlangB_2017,Willena,for the extra fields,0
3383_elmlangB_2017,Raymundo,"but Maybe makes it a runtime problem, when really it should be a compile-time problem",0
3383_elmlangB_2017,Sueann,What about union types?,0
3383_elmlangB_2017,Raymundo,"for context, here was my original thing:
```
type UserFormState
= ChoosingName
| ChoosingAlias { name : String }
| ChoosingAge { name : String, alias : String }
| ChoosingCountry { name : String, alias : String, age : Int }
| ...
```",0
3383_elmlangB_2017,Willena,"depends on how you are using it, I suppose. It generally is a case of how you are interacting / using it",0
3383_elmlangB_2017,Raymundo,it’s a form that has to be filled out in a certain sequence,0
3383_elmlangB_2017,Joey,I think your original solution is the most type-safe way. The downside is that it's more verbose; which is pretty much a one-time cost,0
3383_elmlangB_2017,Raymundo,"so things like `Maybe` allow for a whole mess of invalid states; yeah, bummer that there’s no longer sugar to add fields to records, but that’s fine; i’ll stick with this",0
3383_elmlangB_2017,Joey,"Yeah, it made things considerably slower and made people try to use extensible records as a way of simulating base-class/overriding class type oop",0
3383_elmlangB_2017,Raymundo,"fair enough; it’s true that the pain is a one-time cost, so i guess I’ll just tough it out :smile:; :muscle:",0
3383_elmlangB_2017,Joey,"Yeah, I'm guessing it'll pay off, though - not dealing with a record full of maybe's is nice :slightly_smiling_face:",0
3383_elmlangB_2017,Willena,"for sure; Might end up with something like
```
type UserFormState
= ChoosingName

3383_elmlangB_2017,Raymundo,"yeah, that might be easier to work with",0
3383_elmlangB_2017,Willena,"`type alias NameData = { name : String }`

without having to update other parts",0
3383_elmlangB_2017,Raymundo,i’m a little worried that in my actual project it’s going to look like `PlayerChoosingShip GamePiece GamePiece GamePiece GamePiece` and i’m going to get very confused :smile:,0

3383_elmlangB_2017,Raymundo,"yeah, creating real aliases for these things might actually be the way to go",0
3383_elmlangB_2017,Joey,"<@Sueann> `Decode.dict` assumes your data is an object, with they keys being used as the keys in the dict and the values being decoded by your decoder",0

3559_elmlangB_2017,Hipolito,"Thanks, I think I'm getting the idea. My issue is that I have an unbeatable tic-tac-toe game that's written entirely in Elm, and it takes a long time for the computer to make the first move. I want to disable the board while the computer is 'thinking', so the user can't make a bunch of moves before the board updates. So, my thought was that the user clicking a square would trigger one Msg, calling a function that makes the board unclickable, and then triggers the Msg that tells the computer to make a move. Does that seem like a good reason to trigger a Msg, or am I thinking about it wrong?",0

I'm figuring out how to chain http requests (GET /products, then based on the result get /product/xxx); it's a bit confusing that both commands and tasks seem to be involving in Http.send",1
3569_elmlangB_2017,Lyndsey,<@Luigi> a Cmd is something that will get executed by the runtime and might or might not produce a result that will get back to `update`. A `Task` is conceptually similar but unlike the `Cmd` it can be composed (with `Task.andThen`) and it will always produce a message. With the `http` package you get commands because of convenience. The implementation of `Http.send` is `send resultToMessage request = Task.attempt resultToMessage (toTask request)` :slightly_smiling_face:,2

3641_elmlangB_2017,Dorinda,<@Shavonda> the way you get the data from the textarea is by collecting it from `onInput` events on that textarea and keeping that data in your model,0
3641_elmlangB_2017,Shavonda,oh; well but onInput calls a function every time the input changes,0
3641_elmlangB_2017,Dorinda,yep,0

3641_elmlangB_2017,Maxie,"What would be mental model for doing the following series of steps - 1. User clicks submit for authentication in the login screen
2. Http request is sent to validate username and password(involves a command)

5. After the above is done a new command is fired to redirect to the next page using Elm navigation.
Now all of the above steps involves 3 commands, considering that the command chaining is a bad pattern how would the gurus models it, I ask?; Yeah I really wanted to understand how that is done instead of just abstracting the concept by using something like `elm-bootstrap`",0
3641_elmlangB_2017,Dorinda,"<@Maxie> since you need to do multiple cmds in a sequence you need to thread each one through `update`; but the call to the port and the navigation don't seem to be dependent on each other, so they probably don't need to be chained and could be done at the some time; unless your navigation is an actual reload of the page...",0

2618_elmlangB_2019,Monte,"(caveat that I have pretty limited experience with web components)
When you register a WebComponent elm lets that component handle its own ""sub-dom"", so you could create a webcomponent for a popper and then something like:
```
Html.node ""popper-wrapper""
-- Attributes
[ Html.property ""placement"" ""left""
]
-- Children
[ Html.div [] [ ... ] -- The ""main"" element
, Html.div [] [ ... ] -- The ""popper"" element
]
```; &gt; If nothing like these exist I feel tempted to create a small library or something based in `elm-bootstrap` code for this task.
This'd be a good way to sharpen your elm skills; &gt; When you register a WebComponent elm lets that component handle its own ""sub-dom""
This way Elm wouldn't complain when popper.js modifies any of the elements inside the Web Component, and you get to leverage an existing library instead of rolling your own",0

153_elmlangB_2018,Emely,"Doesn't matter :slightly_smiling_face: The function you will use to get something at a given index will be a `Maybe a`, not a `a`; If you want a `List a` *as an output of that composite function* instead of a `Maybe (List a)` / `List (Maybe a)`, you will have to provide a default value for that function you're trying to make.; I don't have the words to describe my thoughts, I'm sure Ilias will say it better :smile:",0
153_elmlangB_2018,Wiley,"Let's try and talk about this in terms of ""perhaps I'm not fully grasping what you are saying"" rather than right/wrong. Either way, it seems like you could indeed use a `List.Extra.find` here. Essentially you need a signature like `Int -&gt; List a -&gt; Maybe a`. In you case, perhaps you can get away with using an emtpy list as the default,; i.e when an out of bounds index is passed",0
153_elmlangB_2018,Emely,"If that was enough to have hard guarantees, Elm wouldn't need to exist ^^; <@Davina> Can you please tell me what you want in this case:
`[[""Hey"", ""Ho""], [""Foo""]]` with indices `[1, 1]` ?",0
153_elmlangB_2018,Wiley,"You can't guarantee at the type level that the index will exist, but you can provide a sane default if it doesn't. Though explicitly dealing with the failure case may be better nevertheless.",0
153_elmlangB_2018,Emely,"<@Wiley> Well, that's exactly what was saying :slightly_smiling_face: How come everyone understands you, and not me? :smile:",0
153_elmlangB_2018,Wiley,I qualified the guarantee :wink:,0
153_elmlangB_2018,Emely,"<@Davina> Pick the type of result you want from those three. Based on that, it will tell you what to use from my first 3-point bullet list from earlier, and the way to handle a ""default"".; <@Wiley> I did too, but in a more fun fashion: ""You can yell all you want to the compiler ""I will give you an index that is within bounds!"", it won't matter. A `List.find` will give you a Maybe."" Maybe fun isn't as efficient as boring.; :smile: :smile:; (Not that I'm implying that what you're saying is boring!!!); <@Davina> Does that help, to try and pick the type of output you prefer in case one of the index isn't found?",0
153_elmlangB_2018,Davina,"OK...so this discussion has gotten hijacked by something totally tangential. Yes, if the function returns a `Maybe`, I will have to handle it. But that is not what I was referring to.",0

313_elmlangB_2018,Lurline,"So I have multiple ""pages"" that each exist as an elm program. I would like to make a shared module for all of these that deals with some user state (verified email, etc for redirects). Is there an easy way of doing this? I quickly ran into a lot of unknowns the moment I tried to do the http.send request in the module, since that needs an Msg and somehow has to be connected to the update function of the page using it",1
313_elmlangB_2018,Sung,"<@Lurline> what do you mean by ""each exist as an elm program""? Do you have multiple calls to `Html.program`?",0
313_elmlangB_2018,Lurline,"all routing is done by our go webserver, each page is a different Html.program, yes.",0
313_elmlangB_2018,Sung,"ah, alrighty.; A common misunderstanding people have when they first start out with Elm is thinking of modules like you would an object, they're just namespaces for functions and types.",0
313_elmlangB_2018,Lurline,"Yeah, I figured as much. I just wanted to avoid duplicating this code per ""page"". One option would be to do the web request per page, and share the rest. I just wondered if I could somehow also share the web request part.",0
313_elmlangB_2018,Sung,"Yep, so all effects in Elm (eg. http requests) are initiated by returning a `Cmd msg` from `update` and result in a callback to `update` with the result of the effect. From that callback you can call any functions in any modules you like to process that result and update the model.; `Cmd`s need to produce a value that is of the type that `update` expects, functions that return `Cmd`s usually take a function as an argument to convert the value they produce in to a value that is of the type that your `update` expects; eg. `Http.send` is defined as `send : (Result Error a -&gt; msg) -&gt; Request a -&gt; Cmd msg`; it takes a function `(Result Error a -&gt; msg)` that is used to convert from the `Result Error a` value produced from doing the http request in to a value of type `msg` that your `update` expects; So if you write the functions in your user module to take such a function and pass that on to `Http.send` then you can use the function from that module in multiple programs",0

817_elmlangB_2018,Heather,"I’m newcomer and have one major question (my previous question about style-elements is part of it). I’m kind an old school programmer and many years ago after spending a week doing round corners in IE 6.0 decided that I don’t want to deal with frontend technologies. Though my team was working on online site constructor for a couple last years I did not touch frontend code myself. After reading and watching about elm (thanks to <@Lurlene>) I suppose it covers all the pain points for me in web development - old school guys can’t live without compiler :-)
So elm covers Javascript insanity, but what about Html and CSS? I mean is there still a lot of tricks and workarounds (if you support only modern browsers)? Is it painful to code an interface (I mean spend a lot of time on workarounds and trying different tricks)? And if so what is better way to just code interface without troubles? Thanks in advance for help!",1
817_elmlangB_2018,Luvenia,"<@Heather> I find that it pretty much eliminates all of my pain points with Html and CSS, especially if you use the `style-elements` package.",2
817_elmlangB_2018,Damian,Does anyone have experience with `elm-ui`? Pros/Cons?,0
817_elmlangB_2018,Heather,<@Luvenia> the approach of style-elements is very good. Really properties of elements should be divided into two parts: positioning and other. But the best approach for positioning in my opinion is CSS grid. And style-elements are not based on it. It does not even support it.,0
817_elmlangB_2018,Luvenia,"<@Heather> Sure, CSS has come a long way with flex and grid. Writing plain CSS is way better than it used to be. I’ve heard good things about <@Lurlene>’s `elm-css` package too, if you’d prefer to use grid.; One of the nice things about using Elm for Html and CSS is that you can use variables and functions to determine your style. SASS and LESS (and many more) helped fill this gap over the last decade, but it’s nice to be able to just use Elm in the same way for the view as you would use it for the rest of the program.",0
817_elmlangB_2018,Heather,"<@Luvenia> the problem (not sure about elm-css) that styles are inline, though we have a compiler! Separate css file is better in many ways (caching, speed of load and render). It’s not a big deal I suppose to write some automation to change inline styles for classes before production. But it is not very clean way :-( The best approach for me as newcomer would be working in style-element approach but when compiler does all dirty work to prepare everything for production.",0
817_elmlangB_2018,Luvenia,"I think the performance difference is pretty small. In general Elm loads and runs quickly. React is very popular these days as well, and it’s normal to use inline styles for React components. For me, the productivity benefits of using Elm for UI is very attractive–most of my HTML and CSS pain points are in regards to productivity and maintainability.; That being said, it appears that `elm-css` generates external stylesheets, so that might be the way to go.",0

1006_elmlangB_2018,Kai,"I think you'll have the same problems with ports as with flags. You need to convert some of the ""border-safe"" types into your custom type; So, I'd use flags, but you'll have to have some JSON representation of the type and a decoder that makes it into the custom type",2
1006_elmlangB_2018,Mabel,"<@Claudia> the best way is to just send it to Elm as a `Json.Decode.Value` and decode it.; if it is a flag, send it as a flag. :slightly_smiling_face:",2
1006_elmlangB_2018,Claudia,"&gt; I think you’ll have the same problems with ports as with flags. You need to convert some of the “border-safe” types into your custom type
the thing is that if I send some value via ports, then I can specify the decoder. Which could decode to my custom type.",0
1006_elmlangB_2018,Mabel,"<@Claudia> no, you cannot specify the decoder.",0
1006_elmlangB_2018,Claudia,why not?; I’ve just did it,0
1006_elmlangB_2018,Mabel,you can only decode/encode to a type recognized by the port.,0

itemLabelDecoder : Decode.Decoder (Nonempty.Nonempty Char)
itemLabelDecoder =

Decode.fail ""Item label should be non-empty string""
head :: tail -&gt;
Decode.succeed (Nonempty.Nonempty head tail)

Decode.string

```; I decode string first, and then convert is into list of chars; but Flags could not handle this directly",0
1006_elmlangB_2018,Mabel,"sure… but you are using the decoder to decode the string, not automatically",0
1006_elmlangB_2018,Claudia,yes,0
1006_elmlangB_2018,Mabel,"both ports and flags behave specially in that they generate decoders; but the decoders they generate are limited; they can only decode/encode String, Int, Float and Tuples, Maybe, List and Records of these things; (if I remember correctly)",0

type alias Flags = {
item: Decode.Value

instead of ```
type alias Flags = {
item: Item

1006_elmlangB_2018,Kai,"If you put `thatThing : Json.Encode.Value` into your flags, you can use your own decoder on it; yeah",0

Is <#C0CJ3SBBM|general> a better place to ask?; Also, my concern is not about being low cost, but about being lowest cost.; I think I should have asked whether expressing certain ""lowest cost"" logic is a fool's errand in Elm.",0
2140_elmlangB_2018,Sung,I bet that you'd struggle to find an Elm app that does comparison on large enough strings for looking at it to be worth it.,0
2140_elmlangB_2018,Wade,"I definitely hear that well, but it was more of an ""in principle"" sort of question. I'm still struggling to clarify (for myself) the benefits and drawbacks of FP abstractions. I'm not quite used to reaching for subroutines for which I have no idea of the cost.",0
2140_elmlangB_2018,Sung,"I don't think I've known the cost of a function I've called for decades; The code is running in an unknown browser on some unknown hardware, there is a 5 different kinds of JITs that could be optimising it + the Elm compiler might optimise somethings. You've got libraries you call that you need to use but could never fully read.; and the likely bottleneck of your app is layout reflows that can really only be optimised for on an whole app level",0
2140_elmlangB_2018,Wade,"Again, my mindset here is premised on developer/compiler relationships as expressed in differing paradigms, not actually on whether the particular example code is the best idea.; If, instead, these were lists of lists of large records, carefully managing comparisons could become quite important.; I just didn't want to make the example code complex.",0
2140_elmlangB_2018,Tiny,These questions do matter but usually more the implementers of the core libraries and data structures than for application development :slightly_smiling_face:; You may enjoy this talk from ElmEurope last year <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmiNobpx7eI>; It goes through the various collection types in Elm; I forget if it covers strings or not (I think strings are implemented as lists of characters in 0.18),0
2140_elmlangB_2018,Wade,"Thanks!; I think that the practical solution to comparing strings in the manner that I need is to split the strings being compared into two lists of strings, then compare the parts where either string == string or * always equals string. How would I compare lists? Alternately, is there a more considerate approach?; maybe something like `List.compare mycomparefunc list2 list1`",0
2140_elmlangB_2018,Sung,"`==` works for lists; `[1,2,3] == [1,2,3]`",0
2140_elmlangB_2018,Tiny,I'm not well-versed in the various comparison algorithms. The simple way to do it is to compare a character at a time and break early if chars don't match. That can be fun to implement but is unlikely to be faster than whatever the compiler does (use JS `===`?),0
2140_elmlangB_2018,Sung,In the example above it looks like <@Wade> is actually doing searching rather than comparison.,0
2140_elmlangB_2018,Wade,"Maybe find the indexes that are ""*"" in the reference string, and convert them to stars in the tested string, then directly compare the lists...; And with renaming and some cleanup.; <https://ellie-app.com/mtFKFw43Ra1/2>; <https://ellie-app.com/mtFKFw43Ra1/1>; This satisfies the tests, but I am unsure of the quality of the solution.",0

2305_elmlangB_2018,Sung,"They are just values, you can pass them around however you want; but they'll only be run if you return them to the runtime; which is only in the functions that return `Cmd msg` that are called by the runtime, `init` and `update`",0

2305_elmlangB_2018,Suzie,Check the type of the program function,0
2305_elmlangB_2018,Sung,"`Http.send` doesn't do a http call, it just returns a `Cmd msg`",0
2305_elmlangB_2018,Suzie,"The `a` in `Cmd a` has to coincide with that of `update`’s parameter, I.e, Msg.",0
2305_elmlangB_2018,Terrell,right; so what is it about `Http.send`'s return value that eventually causes an actual http call,0
2305_elmlangB_2018,Sung,returning that `Cmd msg` to the runtime results in http call,0
2305_elmlangB_2018,Suzie,Well you can think of there being a few different command types,0
2305_elmlangB_2018,Sung,the `Cmd msg` value contains the instruction to the runtime to make the http call; you can't inspect that value because it's not exposed,0
2305_elmlangB_2018,Terrell,oh; yea i guess i'm asking like what is that value,0

2305_elmlangB_2018,Cara,All of them do.; It's really prevalent in clojure/script...; (CSP via core.async),0

2305_elmlangB_2018,Cara,:shrug:,0
2305_elmlangB_2018,Suzie,Well ; Regular Msgs describe effects in both redux (actions) and elm ; In elm they describe a change on state,0
2305_elmlangB_2018,Terrell,"in redux async is handled via thunks or sagas in my experience, either way you explicitly have to implement the part that's sort of under the covers in Elm; as far as i can tell",0
2305_elmlangB_2018,Cara,"By the way... <@Terrell> if you want to think about those things, I find it's enlightening and helpful to say ""is an instance of monad"" rather than ""is a monad"" by the way :wink: the reason is, it'll stop you trying to think that specific concrete types are Monads when in actual fact, they just subscribe to having functions written for them that make them be able to act as a Monad, but those individual specific things don't *entirely* encapsulate what Monad is by themselves.; which gives you more control.",0
2305_elmlangB_2018,Suzie,Elm is more similar to redux with sagas I guess ; Thunks usually make your action creators impure,0
2305_elmlangB_2018,Terrell,"right so in Elm the ""saga generator functions"" are baked into the runtime and the shape of the actions is opaque?; or is that a stretch; right, Monad is a typeclass in Haskell i know, so that makes sense.

Here's what I came up with so far:
1) More indentation.
2) Cannot reuse code outside of parent function.
3) Cannot unit test functions in `let` block. I think this is the best reason for minimizing code in `let` blocks.

5422_elmlangB_2018,Eldon,"Mouse events do provide coordinates, heres some code for mousemove: <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46305894/in-elm-how-can-i-detect-the-mouse-position-relatively-to-an-html-element>",2
5422_elmlangB_2018,Tinisha,"It depends on what you are doing. If there some click event, and you want to know where the click happened you can do what <@Eldon> recommended and decode that information off the event.; But thats not really “getting” that infomration. More like that information just flows into the update stream. If you really need to know what the mouse’s position is in some arbitrary context that might not be coming from a mouse event, I would store the mouse position in the model, and just keep that field up to date with a mouse move event listener on the window.",2
5422_elmlangB_2018,Renee,Thanks a lot for the answers <@Eldon> <@Tinisha> :slightly_smiling_face: It looks like that `elm-mouse-events` package linked from the Stack Overflow answer will do what I need:bow:,0

6028_elmlangB_2018,Shyla,Well my intention was the output side :stuck_out_tongue:; You have to stringify it eventually; (people read text),0
6028_elmlangB_2018,Mellissa,Ya,0
6028_elmlangB_2018,Hulda,share the error,0
6028_elmlangB_2018,Shyla,I prefer Ethans code; You could always write a form html view that takes the error and renders the right hint,0
6028_elmlangB_2018,Mellissa,Np with that.. but I’m getting a problem with that `Ok (pass)` it says its not matching the signature `Password` (maybe it should be `String`),0
6028_elmlangB_2018,Hulda,what is your `Password` type?,0
6028_elmlangB_2018,Shyla,`Password string`; If you’re using a wrapper type you will have to wrap the output,0
6028_elmlangB_2018,Mellissa,"ah, i had what folker was saying before `type Password = Password String`, not your alias",0
6028_elmlangB_2018,Shyla,Yes; That requires `Password string` to create,0
6028_elmlangB_2018,Hulda,so you can do with or without the alias,0
6028_elmlangB_2018,Mellissa,"im unsure why he suggested what he did, I was thinking it would have been an alias all along?",0
6028_elmlangB_2018,Hulda,and there are pros and cons to each,0
6028_elmlangB_2018,Shyla,"The generally accepted pattern is that style; Its “annotated”; Its not just a string, its a password; Where as with an alias any string will match",0
6028_elmlangB_2018,Hulda,The alias just makes your code more readable,0
6028_elmlangB_2018,Shyla,The downside is you have to explicitly construct it each time,0
6028_elmlangB_2018,Hulda,"The concrete type lets you get some type ""safety""; sorta like a constructor in OOD; imagine you have a module `Data.Password`; and you have a type that looks like this; `type Password = Pass String`; if you don't expose the `Pass` function, but only expose `checkPassword -&gt; Result ... Password`; then it would be impossible for people to construct an instance of the `Password` type that isnt a valid password",0
6028_elmlangB_2018,Mellissa,ohhhh. the `Pass` after `=` in that type declaration is a function??,0
6028_elmlangB_2018,Hulda,"yeah so its a bit confusing, but let me walk you through a bit of that wierdness",0
6028_elmlangB_2018,Mellissa,i guess im not sure what would go in `Pass` vs `checkPassword` but,0
6028_elmlangB_2018,Hulda,lets say this is our type,0
6028_elmlangB_2018,Shyla,Kind of; Its a constructor,0
6028_elmlangB_2018,Hulda,`type Color = Red | Green`,0
6028_elmlangB_2018,Shyla,You can use a function in its place but the default is `Pass : String -&gt; Password`,0
6028_elmlangB_2018,Hulda,in this case our `Color` is basically an enum,0
6028_elmlangB_2018,Shyla,`Red : Color`,0
6028_elmlangB_2018,Hulda,"and in your module declaration you say `exposing (Color(..))` meaning expose the `Color` type as well as all of it's instances (`Red` and `Green`); when we add some data to that enum like this (lets say traffic lights in different countries use different colors... or something); `type TrafficSignal = Go Color | Stop Color | SlowDown Color`; each of the ""instances"" of `TrafficSignal` are functions; `Go: Color -&gt; TrafficSignal`",0
6028_elmlangB_2018,Mellissa,and you’d have to define each?,0
6028_elmlangB_2018,Hulda,"no, they are defined through the `type` declaration; so after I type that line i can say `Go Green` and that will be a `TrafficSignal`; same thing with `Go Red`",0
6028_elmlangB_2018,Mellissa,"OK, so in the above case it would be `Pass pass`",0
6028_elmlangB_2018,Hulda,yeah; so the benefit of this is that you can hide some or all of the constructors,0
6028_elmlangB_2018,Mellissa,and the up-shot of the concrete type is that the only way to get a “real” Password is to throw a string through checkPassword that returns with Pass pass,0
6028_elmlangB_2018,Hulda,yep,0
6028_elmlangB_2018,Mellissa,:+1:,0
6028_elmlangB_2018,Hulda,"you just dont expose `Pass`; this is kinda a specific example though, most of the time a type alias will do just fine; even in this case its a design decision",0
6028_elmlangB_2018,Mellissa,hrm so how would i “coerce” a hard `Password` type back into a string?,0
6028_elmlangB_2018,Hulda,you would either put the function that needs it as a string in the password module (where it will have access to `Pass` and you can do a case statement) or expose a `getContents : Password -&gt; String` function,0
6028_elmlangB_2018,Mellissa,"thought it would be the latter, makes sense",0
6028_elmlangB_2018,Hulda,"up to you though; generally speaking, this is sometimes called the ""newtype pattern""; <https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.0.0/style/features/types/newtype.html>; <http://degoes.net/articles/newtypes-suck>; (oops, thought that just explained it, it takes a specific stance on their usage)",0

6028_elmlangB_2018,Hulda,None; that fixes your syntax at least; <https://ellie-app.com/3YzqHrkXxNGa1>,0
6028_elmlangB_2018,Mellissa,"the thought of tossing around `typedPassword` in between the `update` and the `view` function that uses it gives me the heebees, b/c it will be easy to introduce a bug where you remove it getting set and it never works, but alas i guess we cannot get rid of *all* the bugs",0
6028_elmlangB_2018,Hulda,^^ yep that too; let me take a crack at fixing up your code a bit,0
6028_elmlangB_2018,Mellissa,interesting… whats the reasoning behind having to do this construction of sticking everything into one `{}` or using the `let..newModel...case`; (e.g. why can’t you do two `{}`; in one case,0
6028_elmlangB_2018,Hulda,"eh, just naming intermediate steps and being easier to read",0

6028_elmlangB_2018,Hulda,"you are changing two related fields so its whatever to me; (I would install elm-format if you havent already btw, it helps make it pretty); <https://ellie-app.com/3YzwtB6JbGCa1>; okay here it is a bit more functional",0
6028_elmlangB_2018,Mellissa,"Nice, I made nearly the same changes, but instead made `password = Maybe Password` in the model; so in the update the case becomes `Just pwd`; I can see the value of both approaches (holding onto your errors); so, what is the best approach with having multiple models and updates… b/c right now it seems that the Model is just a giant freaking dict of every possible interaction on the page all slammed together in one object; And same with `update`, it will eventually be a case statement of every possible interaction",0

6028_elmlangB_2018,Mellissa,but only one `update` per module/file?,0
6028_elmlangB_2018,Hulda,not exactly what i mean... i would read over the spa example,0
6028_elmlangB_2018,Mellissa,"K, will do",0

6028_elmlangB_2018,Eldon,"not necessarily one `update` per module, for example if my `update` starts getting quite big branch for single message, I can split it to separate `updateBigMessage` in same module",0

Just recursively calling update? Generating a new Cmd Msg isn't the recommended way, right?; I'm not sure that's quite the same thing.; Basically, when one event hits a certain condition, it creates the need to trigger a different event.; But that second event can get triggered multiple ways.; Not all of which are from within the updates.",0
6240_elmlangB_2018,Tiny,"In general, it's helpful to think of messages as a way for the _outside world_ to tell your Elm app that an event happened",0
6240_elmlangB_2018,Masako,"Ok, that makes sense. Maybe I can extract it into a function actually. I might've been getting a bit too liberal with my update cases.",0
6240_elmlangB_2018,Tiny,I like to keep my `update` pretty slim. Just pointing external events to other functions; that makes it easy to point multiple events at the same function,0
6240_elmlangB_2018,Masako,"Yeah. Been trying to do that. And looking at it, it might just be this last one I'm considering that's breaking with that.; It can be triggered either by a timer expiring or if the user has typed a certain amount of words, basically.",0
6240_elmlangB_2018,Olin,"Yep, it's eye opening to realize that a `case-of` branch can always be replaced with a single function call",0
6240_elmlangB_2018,Masako,Both of which are outside actions/events.; But I think there are already updates that handle both of those actions/events from which a function could be called,0
6240_elmlangB_2018,Loriann,<@Masako> that does sound like it should be it's own event,0
6240_elmlangB_2018,Masako,"So that would eliminate the need for a separate event for it; Since there's an event that updates a visual clock with the timer, and there's an event that records the words as they're typed.; So in those it would be natural to call this function that handles the end of the scenario by either calling it when the timer runs out or the word count has been reached; But that the scenario ended feels like an event in my head. :slightly_smiling_face:; (If this makes sense. Not sure if I'm explaining clearly enough)",0
6240_elmlangB_2018,Tiny,That makes sense. Making a function that gets called from both the `ClockTick` and `UserTyped` branches of the update is a good idea,0
6240_elmlangB_2018,Olin,"We also wanted to reuse Msgs in the beginning, but later on we found that it can be very difficult to understand how that ""event"" is happening in a buggy case. So we started splitting different use cases to separate Msgs for easier debugging. Then, talking with other people I've come to the conclusion that most people go through this same progression",0
6240_elmlangB_2018,Masako,I think it's natural to start thinking of the whole system as being very msg based once you get going. :slightly_smiling_face:; Like Erlang.,0

6240_elmlangB_2018,Masako,"Okay, I think I'm back on the right track, then. I really appreciate the feedback and the schooling. Thanks, folks! (Take that, slackbot)",0
6240_elmlangB_2018,Tiny,I wonder if that's partially because a lot of examples use the imperative mode for their message names (e.g. `SetComment`) rather than describing an event that happened (e.g. `UserTyped`) :thinking_face:,0
6240_elmlangB_2018,Masako,"I can attest to my message names being a mix of imperative and past tense.; Is making them &lt;something happened&gt; the recommended style?; Seems a little counterintuitive. Like I have one that triggers a save to local storage, but that save hasn't happened yet when the branch triggers.",0
6240_elmlangB_2018,Tiny,"There's no official recommendation; exactly, the message shouldn't be about what is going to happen in the `update`; instead it should tell you about an event that happened in the outside world; saving to local storage could be triggered by all sorts of events such as the user clicking a button, a timer ticking forward, etc; your `update` then ""reacts"" to those events",0
6240_elmlangB_2018,Masako,"So you're saying I should have a general event for timer ticks and handle all possible events related inside that?; Like in my case, a timer tick can trigger both a save and a timer countdown.; Right now I have them as separate branches",0
6240_elmlangB_2018,Hyun,"<@Masako> but _what_ triggers a save to local storage, is it `SaveRequested` or `FieldUnfocused`. Naming events in the past tense makes these things clearer, so that’s why you do it.",0
6240_elmlangB_2018,Tiny,If you have multiple timers give each their own events,0
6240_elmlangB_2018,Masako,"So maybe something like `SaveTimerTicked` or something, then?",0
6240_elmlangB_2018,Tiny,right,0
6240_elmlangB_2018,Masako,"Right now they could be the same timer, since they're on the same interval, tbh, but that will probably change, which is why I have them separate.; Well, will pretty much definitely change once I'm saving to a database rather than local storage.",0
6240_elmlangB_2018,Hyun,"We have it so that instead of returning `Cmd ...` we return our own command type, and there we have things in the imperative, like `SaveToLocalStorage`; this also makes it more clear; and then when it’s saved you get a `SavedToLocalStorage` event etc",0
6240_elmlangB_2018,Tiny,"IMO the important thing is for event names to reflect _what happened_, not _how you plan on handling it_",0
6240_elmlangB_2018,Hyun,"and our backend is event sourced too, so that makes it very nice",0
6240_elmlangB_2018,Masako,That makes sense.,0
6240_elmlangB_2018,Hyun,"It’s up to you of course, but having it like that has helped us a lot; At first it seems strange to have `SaveObjectButtonClicked` instead of `SaveObject` or whatever, but when you have a number of those you appreciate the clarity",0
6240_elmlangB_2018,Masako,"Yeah, I'm going over my update function now and considering each branch.; I can definitely see the argument. I might go through a little batch job of renaming events. :slightly_smiling_face:; And I definitely think it will make it more obvious when something just belongs in a function, vs. when it's a response to something that happened.; Thanks again, gang! :slightly_smiling_face:; Anyway, I have to go make dinner for the kids now, so off I go, but I really appreciate the time you're willing to take to help us noobs out. :slightly_smiling_face:",0

113_pythondev_2017,Collette,I mean what makes you think that this is the most expensive operation? Do you _think_ so or you have profiled your code so you _know_ it's the most expensive operation?,0
113_pythondev_2017,Ruben,"Looking up one record in your user table, and updating that record, is really the bottleneck? That sounds quite suprising to me, too.",0
113_pythondev_2017,Collette,"That may be the bottleneck, for sure. Which is likely to be fixed by creating a proper index.",0
113_pythondev_2017,Ciera,anyways in sql you are able to retrieve data from an `update` query,0
113_pythondev_2017,Lasonya,<@Ruben> <@Collette> won't it be performant to have one db trip to fetch and update rather than have two trips?,0
113_pythondev_2017,Collette,"<@Lasonya> please, google about premature optimization",0
113_pythondev_2017,Ruben,Your remark smells like premature optimisation,0
113_pythondev_2017,Collette,Ha,0
113_pythondev_2017,Lasonya,i like this <@Ciera>,0
113_pythondev_2017,Ruben,"<@Ciera> Some DBMSses indeed can, see RETURNING clause in PostgreSQL's UPDATE. <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/sql-update.html>",0
113_pythondev_2017,Ciera,yeah that's what I was referring to,0
113_pythondev_2017,Ruben,...but don't expect such things to work in MySQL or Oracle.; I never found the need to return something from an UPDATE (except maybe the nr. of records that were changed) because what I put into the UPDATE I have available in my program anyway.; <@Ciera> So I'm curious about for what you want such a feature.,0
113_pythondev_2017,Ciera,we use it from time to time when we need to return ids for some processing (for example),0
113_pythondev_2017,Suellen,"&gt; what I put into the UPDATE I have available in my program anyway
Not when there is an SQL function / expression in an UPDATE clause",0
113_pythondev_2017,Ciera,you have available what you put in the update but you might not have all the row; if you have read only data for example,0
113_pythondev_2017,Ruben,"Ah ok, I see. That might be handy indeed.",0
113_pythondev_2017,Suellen,I have to add: I don't think `UPDATE ... RETURNING ...` will increase performance substantially for a typical web app; even the fastest ORM (something like Peewee) is still quite slow,0
113_pythondev_2017,Ciera,if your db is on the network you gain a bit; but otherwise not really. It's just a nice to have,0
113_pythondev_2017,Suellen,"plus if I can get an empty page in 30 ms and a heavy page in 40 ms, then there is no point in optimizing just yet",0
113_pythondev_2017,Lasonya,Thanks guys <@Ciera> <@Ruben> <@Collette> <@Suellen> :taco:,0
113_pythondev_2017,Suellen,yum yum!,0
288_pythondev_2017,Katheryn,What is the strategy to decide limit for number of processes when working with `multiprocessing`?,1
288_pythondev_2017,Beula,"I'd favor `concurrent.futures` (or the `futures` backport if you are on python2).; Basically you can define a pool with the max workers; ```
import concurrent.futures
with concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers=2) as pool:
pool.submit(print, 'Hello World')
```; (untested and from memory <@Katheryn> :point_up::skin-tone-4:)",2
288_pythondev_2017,Katheryn,"Sure, let me explore `futures`. So, I’ll be doing I/O with these forked processes. Reading from the web, suggestions are to keep workers equal to number of cores. Is that reasonable?",0
288_pythondev_2017,Beula,"Yep, that's usually what I see/hear around. Note that if you are doing I/O - probably best to use `ThreadPoolExecutor` since your bottlekneck isn't CPU and processes in python are expensive; Especially resource sharing",0
288_pythondev_2017,Katheryn,Thanks. Let me read more on the subject,0
327_pythondev_2017,Claudia,Hi! What TUI library would you guys recommend learning? I want to make GUIs for the terminal but I dont want any new windows opening,1
327_pythondev_2017,Suellen,easy or hard? :stuck_out_tongue:,0
327_pythondev_2017,Claudia,"Whatever really, as long as it gives me the oppertunity to develop some kind of gui for an application for the terminal :slightly_smiling_face:",0
327_pythondev_2017,Suellen,"<https://github.com/pfalcon/picotui>; There was another project like that but I can't find it!; Very similar, with windows and common elements like checkboxes...; If you want something more barebones, then good old `curses`, or `bearlibterminal` for a modern approach, though it's aimed at games",2
327_pythondev_2017,Claudia,"Thanks, will check them out!",0
360_pythondev_2017,Myong,Is there any way to run pycharm in debug with commandline arguments?,1
360_pythondev_2017,Meg,yes,2
360_pythondev_2017,Beula,"Yeah, you can use the same run menu with command line args and click the debug icon instead of play - or are you seeing something funky?",2
360_pythondev_2017,Meg,go to run configuration,0
360_pythondev_2017,Myong,Is it under the script parameters,0
360_pythondev_2017,Beula,Yep; those are the args passed to it,0
360_pythondev_2017,Myong,Got it; I'm using a module called `simple_settings` and after a few times of accessing the configured settings I get; lol; But the stack trace pretty much shows all calls to the `simple_settings` module and I really don't understand why. I think I may just not use that at all to be honest. But wasn't sure if it was a mistake I made; It seems to be going between these two,0
360_pythondev_2017,Ciera,well the stacktraces is pretty explicit; python as a recursion limit that you reached,0
360_pythondev_2017,Myong,"Yeah, I guess maybe I didn't actually setup the module properly; But it's odd that it goes between the two over and over I'm trying to get to it in debug",0
360_pythondev_2017,Ciera,well in fact the `__getattr__` func call `setup` and `setup` call `__getattr__` so it's endless,0
360_pythondev_2017,Myong,cant even debug to where it breaks,0
360_pythondev_2017,Ciera,well it breaks as soon as the class is init or called; as `__getattr__` is used quite a lot,0
360_pythondev_2017,Myong,"Yeah, looking at some stuff now it basically says if `__getattrb__` can access a variable which does not yet exist it will go into infinite recursion; alright got rid of the module, not sure what was happening, figured out a different way",0
436_pythondev_2017,Kristopher,"I’m running into this in django but I think it’s a conceptual question that anybody can answer. I’m trying to write unit tests and in one of my cases, I get “myapp.models.DoesNotExist: MyModelClass matching query does not exist.” I can’t seem to actually access this exception in django and it does not seem like the parent class, “ObjectDoesNotExist” can handle this exception either.

If the key for the thumbnail is found in the Key Value Store, the serialized thumbnail information is fetched from it and returned.

759_pythondev_2017,Johana,add_all ?,0
759_pythondev_2017,Orpha,so right now; i have this in a for loop,0
759_pythondev_2017,Johana,oh you are using the orm.,0
759_pythondev_2017,Orpha,yea,0
759_pythondev_2017,Johana,then you will need to use session.merge(),0
759_pythondev_2017,Orpha,"i can take it out of the loop and use add_all; ok, yea i was looking at that just now; im moving files to s3 and storing url in db, but i have to handle duplicates; just incase #clients",0
759_pythondev_2017,Johana,i wouldn’t consider that a bulk insert but ok.,0
759_pythondev_2017,Orpha,fair enough,0
759_pythondev_2017,Johana,through the orm you would have to look through all of them and .merge() them to the system.,0
759_pythondev_2017,Orpha,"i haven’t actually read into it, but im assuming the current way im doing it is bad performance wise",0
759_pythondev_2017,Johana,"yea, the fastest thing you’ll get is using the core.",0
759_pythondev_2017,Orpha,sort of like doing a raw insert in a for loop 1000x times,0
759_pythondev_2017,Gabriele,Moving the commit out of the loop will likely help a lot,0
759_pythondev_2017,Johana,yea; it will commit everything at once.; remember that the session is like a recorder.,0
759_pythondev_2017,Orpha,"yea, that was my other question",0
759_pythondev_2017,Johana,it records everything in order and executes everything in that order when you do `session.commit()`,0
759_pythondev_2017,Orpha,"is it worth doing a list then add all at once then commit, or just move the commit out",0
759_pythondev_2017,Gabriele,<@Chu> Why don't you want to use `loads`?,0

759_pythondev_2017,Gabriele,"<@Orpha> If there's no good reason why you need to commit after each one, then don't do it. Usually you would commit after a coherent block of work has been completed.

759_pythondev_2017,Chu,It consumes a lot of memory and CPU time in my scale. Looking for optimization.,0
759_pythondev_2017,Orpha,anywhere from 1 to 7k,0
759_pythondev_2017,Gabriele,"I don't know of a faster way than to use `loads`, sorry",0

759_pythondev_2017,Gabriele,the commit won't affect that,0
759_pythondev_2017,Orpha,well… it does,0
759_pythondev_2017,Johana,did you try .merge instead of .add?,0
759_pythondev_2017,Gabriele,"at some point, a commit will happen, and your duplicates will get found",0

934_pythondev_2017,Jorge,use ```break```,0
934_pythondev_2017,Chi,not allowed for this homework assignment,0
934_pythondev_2017,Jorge,"write some condition in while ,eg:; ```while count&lt;0```",0
934_pythondev_2017,Chi,"maybe some context would help. the assignment is to recreate the game of “Pig”, human vs computer. player rolls a die, and can keep rolling as many times as they want, and then the other player rolls. first player to 50 wins. if you roll a 6, your entire score for that round is 0. I’m work on the ask_yes_or_no method, which includes a prompt.",0
934_pythondev_2017,Ciera,"```
a = True
while a:
a = False
```",0
934_pythondev_2017,Shelly,"<@Chi> if you need to prompt, you can use something like `input(""Enter yes or no"")`",0
934_pythondev_2017,Chi,"the code is doing the opposite of what I want it to do.; not sure if it’s appropriate to post the entire thing here (it’s 100 lines); this is the prompt function ```def ask_yes_or_no(prompt): roll_again = True
while roll_again:
answer = input(prompt)
if answer.startswith(""y"") or answer == ""yes"":
roll_again = False #why does it run properly when roll_again = False and not True?
elif answer.startswith(""n"") or answer == ""no"":
break #not allowed, but not sure how else to get out of this
else:
print(""sorry, what was that?"") ```; when it’s nested in the computer_move method, and i run the program, if I type “no” it loops back and rolls the die again. if i type “yes” it just keeps asking “roll again?”",0
934_pythondev_2017,Meg,"so, a while loop looks at the variable sequence and evaluates it to true or false.; you only set `roll_again` once in the loop, and that's when the input is that of 'Yes, I want to roll again'; you should set `roll_again` to be True` in the `if` and `False` in the `elif` block",0
934_pythondev_2017,Chi,"```def ask_yes_or_no(prompt): roll_again = True
while roll_again:
answer = input(prompt)
if answer.startswith(""y"") or answer == ""yes"":
roll_again = True #why does it run properly when roll_again = False and not True?
elif answer.startswith(""n"") or answer == ""no"":
roll_again = False
#break #not allowed, but not sure how else to get out of this
else:
print(""sorry, what was that?"") ```; when i enter “yes”, it just endlessly keeps asking “roll again?” when i enter “no”, it rolls the die",0
934_pythondev_2017,Meg,then the issue is whatever else is within the conditionals that you're not posting here; you can post a code snippet by pressing the + at the side of the text entry and selecting `Code or Text Snippet`,0
934_pythondev_2017,Shelly,<@Chi> I feel like something is missing here,0
934_pythondev_2017,Chi,ok. this is the whole program so far,0
934_pythondev_2017,Meg,"so with `ask_yes_or_no`, you're not returning a value there to use within the `while computer:` loop; so you should modify the `ask_yes_or_no` conditionals to
```
if answer.startswith('y') or answer == 'yes':
return True
elif answer.startswith('n') or answer == 'no':
return False
else:
print('Sorry?')
```; because a `return` inside a loop is an implicit break execution",0
934_pythondev_2017,Chi,that doesn’t break the loop. it continues to roll the die,0
934_pythondev_2017,Meg,but I think you have your whole program structured wrong.,0
934_pythondev_2017,Chi,we have to use the functions provided. starter code of sorts,0
934_pythondev_2017,Meg,is this intro to programming?,0

1626_pythondev_2017,Staci,"Alright, I got a question I'm hoping one of you might be able to point me in a better direction.
I'm trying to identify an item based on the name given in an a Description. There are about 25-30 possible items and each possible item has anywhere from 2-20 possible spelling/spacing/wordorder/special characters combinations in the description. For example something like this:
```
ICE_WATER = [""ice/water shield"", ""i/w shield 1 sq"", ""i/w shield 1sq"", ""i/w"",
""i/w shield - surface area"", ""i/w valley"", ""i/w shield"", ]
```
There are overlaps in the description names with other items, so I don't think using any ""distance"" or other search algo will get me accurate results. Hence why I've resorted to exact name matching. (If you disagree maybe I could give you some more examples and I could look into it more.)
originally, I put these all the possible names in one large dictionary with the function to call as the value. I didn't really like how long and ugly the list was and difficult to maintain (as I find new possible items or terms are added) so I'm wondering how ugly/slow using a long list of `if/elif desc in ITEM_LIST` might affect my program (as long as it doesn't add more than a second I think I'll deal with it) or if there is another alternate (possibly even obvious) method I can use to identify these items (each with different calculations that need to be performed). And route them to the appropriate (now) methods.",0
1626_pythondev_2017,Arlene,"You mean, curl request get response; than in other variable do the jq stuff?",0
1626_pythondev_2017,Staci,"I'll probably clean it up to where I'm only assigning 2 or 3 attributes per item rather than a separate method for each, but I still need a better way to identify them.",0
1626_pythondev_2017,Arlene,it be nice if .py had switch statement; i think it make this easier; but maybe you can write your own switch,0
1626_pythondev_2017,Staci,You can make a switch with a dictionary; That's essentially what I had before,0
1626_pythondev_2017,Marcie,"<@Arlene> from testing this might do it
```ID=""$(curl -X GET $PLATFORM_URL/foo \
-H ""x-cookie: token=$TOKEN"" \
| jq "".[] | .[] | select(.name==\""$NAME\"") | .id"")""```; as this works:
```NAME=foobar
echo ""$(cat ./test.json | jq "".[] | select(.name==\""${NAME}\"")"" )""```",0
1626_pythondev_2017,Staci,I guess I could put all of the descriptions in a table with their appropriate attributes and query the table,0

1626_pythondev_2017,Marcie,"<@Staci> you could have descriptions and associated calls in a dict; something like
```checks = {
'ice_water': [""ice/water shield"", ""i/w shield 1 sq"", ""i/w shield 1sq"", ""i/w"",
""i/w shield - surface area"", ""i/w valley"", ""i/w shield""]
}
def identify_item(self):
for func_name, attributes in checks.items():
if self.desc in attributes:
getattr(self, func_name)()
break```; though i'd probably move away from the whole bunch of methods on self to more of a composition style in general; yeah thats my normal flow",0
1626_pythondev_2017,Staci,"Yea, that is my plan, I just need a way of identifying the items so I can assign the appropriate attributes; I think I may have talked myself into just creating a table, that way it won't require a code change if/when I need to add items in the future; or descriptions rather; but I appreciate your feedback <@Marcie> I like that pretty well",0

'very open question' - so? what's the point? a question is a question. i dont see/understand how this answers the question helpfully, but in the event it does, then someone please inform me
why tf does slack not have italics....; _underscore_ must be a very specific kinda markdown (aka: a specific version of markdown, but all versions are specifics, so 'specific version' is redundant)
looks like _cmd/ctrl + /_ to bring up 'the keyboard shortcuts shows a common _cmd/ctrl + i_ also works. in fact maybe _underscore_ is not even markdown.

80_pythondev_2019,Clint,"UI/UX is the interface between data/functionality and Users, Python, deals mostly with coding logic, data storage, parsing, etc, (hence being called backend language) Python as such has very little if any direct contact with a user. Hence a GUI or another language is used as a way to display the logic, and or data to a user. UI/UX is the methodology of making that GUI or Display language(HTML, CSS, SASS, Javascript, as a few examples) Play nicely with users in a fashion that makes it easier for users to understand with out needing to know what goes into the product. Also with markdown, it is a language similar to HTML and slack uses it to interpret the messages typed into the chat boxes, as such symbols such as _ etc, have special abilities granted to them through the markdown language so it may not be UI/UX limitation you are working with so much as a markdown limitation, or lack of enough markdown syntax knowledge; Udemy has some good programing courses, I teach python at a school here in Utah, but it is not a cheap option, there are also a lot of free resources on line, but they tend to be un organized and you have to be careful that you find current resources, as a lot of stuff out there can be out of date and not of much use for current development practices.",2

- there are py UI 'frameworks' that are made with py, and that is all UI/UX so this is categorically inaccurate -- 'hence being called backend language) Python as such has very little if any direct contact with a user'
- &amp; so it is supposely the case that the relevant info imma looking for does not exist in the brains of ppl that do/know &amp; limited to to 'back-end only/mostly'
- maybe what is intended to be said is that py was originally meant/made for only for 'back-end' and has never advanced since, or that ppl's knowledge have not at the same pace as py
'UI/UX limitation you are working with so much as a markdown limitation' -- 'markdown is a UI/UX interface, &amp; thereby it is fundamentally a UI/UX limitation, and this is obvious to 99.9% of ppl/users

80_pythondev_2019,Clint,"UI/UX is not the software you are looking at, the software a user looks at is what is known as a Front End coding languages, UI, is the methodology is the process of using front end languages like HTML, Markdown, styling such as CSS, in a way so that a User can Interact with the program that has been written, it does not need to be a great experience but a user needs to be able to push a button and the desired effect happens, UI is setting up that button, Back end languages such as Python and Ruby, C# etc, are what make the Button do something.
UX is a methodology that improves the User Experience, sure you have a button and it does something, but is it intuitive and was it easy for the user to figure out what to do with a minimal amount of explanation. You combine the 2 to improve the over all usage of the application be it a web site, web app mobile app etc.
In fact because most of the work that goes in to UI/UX is in User research and design, Often the UI/UX lead does very little if any actual programing. They are very customer facing and need to know the current flows in styles in the market, try and improve UX, etc, Most of my friend who work in UI/UX work directly with a front end engineering team so that they (the front end team) can program out the Design and the UI/UX based on his (the UI/UX engineer) research, The Front End team will work with the Back End team to make sure the functionality is happening as it should. The languages Used in Front end languages will always have some direct correlation to restrictions on what can be done from a UI/UX point of view, but as they improve the options on how to use them Will improve as well.
This is very simplified as there are a lot more moving pieces, but I hope that gives you a better Idea of what is going on.
Good luck in your programing journey",0
80_pythondev_2019,Jacinta,"*'the software a user looks at is what is known as a Front End coding languages' - absolutely not*
could link to 10 reliable sources that claims this, and that not reliable sources says otherwise
* the software a user looks at is clearly &amp; obviously UI, maybe in one tiny area of 'back-end dev' or a tiny sub-section of society in this universe ppl think the software a user looks is 'Front End coding languages'
* if in the extremely rare event (0.000011111%) that there are 10 reliable sources, and no reliable sources says otherwise, then this most definitely not what i mean by UX/UI. i ofc mean it in the common usage of the term/word that ppl that actually know about UX/UI talk about
(aka: i've never heard anything so false in my entire life thus far)
UI = user interface (a thing, an object, what the user sees), and that is *not* a methodology (method for a process), and if there's a sub-meaning or related meant/intended by a diff word, im not sure which phrase/word is actually meant. user interface is very obviously
&amp; im incredibly astounded at how few (proportionally) ppl in the universe know about UX/UI and no wonder why we have such lacking UX/UI in 2019-ongoing, im honestly jsut speechless right now",0

635_pythondev_2019,Deangelo,"Hello, complete newbie here.
What's the best way to build a python microservice with a REST api, without the overhead of a heavy web framework?",1
635_pythondev_2019,Marita,<@Deangelo> Flask is very popular for microservices.,2
635_pythondev_2019,Deangelo,Thanks <@Marita>; would you say Falcon is in par with Flask? <https://fgimian.github.io/blog/2018/05/17/choosing-a-fast-python-api-framework/>,0
635_pythondev_2019,Marita,"@Simo Never used Falcon. So I’m not sure. Flask is very popular, so you’ll probably have more tutorials available for it.",0
635_pythondev_2019,Deangelo,"cool, I might perhaps also use a swagger code generator to build the api interface dynamically based on api specs",0
635_pythondev_2019,Carmen,Flask literally took me a single Python script and an HTML template to build a microservice. It's hard to get much simpler and faster than that.,2
635_pythondev_2019,Deangelo,"good to know. by the way, I'm not looking to serve html, just a plain rest interface to do some calcs, call another service and return back numbers; which is why I don't need all the features of a web framework",0
635_pythondev_2019,Carmen,"Then yeah, you could potentially implement the entire thing in a single Python file.",0
635_pythondev_2019,Hiroko,"<@Deangelo> if you're interested in having async, you can make your own pretty easily with aiohttp or quart ; Quart is basically flask on asyncio",0
635_pythondev_2019,Deangelo,thanks <@Hiroko> I'm currently looking at integrating a swagger generator and either flask or falcon using the generated client to implement the api endpoints,0
635_pythondev_2019,Hiroko,"reason I pointed out async is you described your desires as
&gt;just a plain rest interface to do some calcs, call another service and return back numbers; which, to me, means lots of blocking actions; if you’re able to do them concurrently, means better workload overall and more efficiency",0
635_pythondev_2019,Deangelo,that's a good point. I'm surprised python can do async. does it implement an event loop to achieve this?,0
635_pythondev_2019,Hiroko,"yes; but unlike node, python has multithreading and multiprocessing; so you can kick off the compute intensive futures to threads and processes to execute; whereas with node, you’re all single threaded in the event loop, which means if you’re doing compute with IO returns, that’s clogging up the event loop",0
635_pythondev_2019,Jonas,"Threading can be a bit tricky though, as technically python itself is single threaded",0
635_pythondev_2019,Hiroko,correct. but you can also set it up so one asyncio event loop exists per thread; <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52298922/how-do-i-set-the-asyncio-event-loop-for-a-thread-in-python/52301233#52301233>,0
635_pythondev_2019,Jonas,"So you need to be somewhat careful about what you offload to a thread, if it calls a C function that doesn't release the GIL then bad things can happen",0
635_pythondev_2019,Hiroko,":point_up:; as always, there’s no silver bullet. there’s always caveats and edge cases",0
635_pythondev_2019,Deangelo,"so this looks like something you can easily introduce to an existing flask application, or does it have to be setup when creating the project?",0
635_pythondev_2019,Hiroko,check out <https://github.com/pgjones/quart>,0
635_pythondev_2019,Deangelo,I was just looking there,0
635_pythondev_2019,Jonas,"it's not usually something you can just plug into an existing app; you'd need to make big changes to how it works. For example, you can't do `requests.get()` in the service; if you're interacting with a database, that needs to be changed; it's well worth it though. 90+% of the time spent in a flask app is just networking stuff: redis, the database, receiving/reading the response",0
635_pythondev_2019,Deangelo,&gt; It should be possible to migrate to Quart from Flask by a find and replace of flask to quart and then adding async and await keywords. See the docs for full details.,0
635_pythondev_2019,Hiroko,"FWIW, Quart is the Flask API ported to use asyncio and aiohttp",0
635_pythondev_2019,Deangelo,<https://pgjones.gitlab.io/quart/flask_migration.html>,0
635_pythondev_2019,Hiroko,"I personally have issues with Flask architecture, including the use of globals; so for me, it made more sense to build with aiohttp.; also, aiohttp is compatible with uwsgi, whereas quart will need to use uvloop, Daphene, or another ASGI compatible server",0
635_pythondev_2019,Jonas,"^; the globals always smelled weird to me. I get that it looks nice in a small, 1 file app; but ergh, it's really too magical; That flask migration page is really way to short; for a hello-world ""read a response, output a template"" app sure, but for any flask app that does _anything_, it will need more work than is described there",0
635_pythondev_2019,Corey,<@Jonas> :+1:,0
635_pythondev_2019,Selene,"That's why I picked Sanic- replace the globals with function arguments, which made me happy; Of course, the use case for my async app is pretty low surface, so can't really speak on whether it was a good choice or not haha",0
635_pythondev_2019,Hiroko,"there was an interesting breakdown about sanic on reddit abut 8 months or so ago; basically, the premise was that its fail fast tendency and speed of breaking changes increased the instability of apps built on it",0
635_pythondev_2019,Selene,"Yeah, I could see that, although it's still like 0.3 or something, right :slightly_smiling_face: weird to complain too much about that",0
635_pythondev_2019,Hiroko,"ah, here we go. <https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/876msl/sanic_python_web_server_thats_written_to_die_fast/>

635_pythondev_2019,Karoline,"I have issues with the Flask architecture, but honestly I continue to use it because in the end they aren't that large. I'd definitely recommend someone new stick to one of the main offerings like Flask or Django, and not use one of the more niche things.",0
635_pythondev_2019,Deangelo,"ok, thanks",0

910_pythondev_2019,Sasha,"If you're going to be doing the same operation repeatedly, it's probably worth it to build an index dict. But for a one-off, you don't have much choice but to scan through the entries one way or another, yeah.",2

1203_pythondev_2019,Lynelle,adding a vertex to an adjacency matrix is quoted at O(v^2) - if python uses a list of lists - wouldn't it be just O(v) ?,2
1203_pythondev_2019,Clemmie,For a list of list you need a nested loop - assuming an n x n size a nested loop is O(n^2),0
1203_pythondev_2019,Bethany,what is the structure used for the adjacency matrix? Sparse matrix format like CSR style?; 2D array?,0
1203_pythondev_2019,Lynelle,None; 2d array; I think it's still O(v) - you don't need a nested loop,0
1203_pythondev_2019,Clemmie,How are you iterating through the rows?; that is the first loop,0
1203_pythondev_2019,Bethany,"well if you're adding a connection to an existing node, it should be constant time",0
1203_pythondev_2019,Clemmie,then each row is a loop,0
1203_pythondev_2019,Bethany,adding a new node would require reallocating the whole thing more than likely,0
1203_pythondev_2019,Lynelle,"yes, adding/removing an edge is O(1)",0
1203_pythondev_2019,Bethany,"generally adjacency matrix if it's large would be represented in sparse form, which is usually more of a dict of 1d arrays; or rather, two 1d arrays i think",0
1203_pythondev_2019,Lynelle,pseudocode would be like; `for r in rows: r.append(0)`,0
1203_pythondev_2019,Bethany,"so you could imagine adding a new vertex would be closer to allocate(v) and append(v), where the append is amortized constant",0
1203_pythondev_2019,Lynelle,"then; `list.append([0,0,0,1,0])`",0
1203_pythondev_2019,Clemmie,where did you get list?,0
1203_pythondev_2019,Lynelle,it's just the entire list; first step is adding a 0 or 1 to the end of each row; second step is appending a list - basically the last row of the 2d array,0
1203_pythondev_2019,Clemmie,Did you see this discussion on Stack Exchange - <https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/297730/why-adding-a-vertex-in-a-graph-represented-using-an-adjacency-matrix-takes-ov>,0
1203_pythondev_2019,Lynelle,"yep; there's another SO thread that says it's implementation dependent; in a 2d array list of lists in python, we don't have to re-allocate the entire thing",0
1203_pythondev_2019,Clemmie,"Right - that looks like the canonical algorithm is v^2, but fairly simple to do better",0
1203_pythondev_2019,Bethany,yeah depending on growth schemes and memory allocators its different,0
1203_pythondev_2019,Lynelle,thanks guys!,0
1203_pythondev_2019,Bethany,are your edges directed?,0
1203_pythondev_2019,Lynelle,"in that green picture i posted - I guess they would be - 0 points to 1, and 1 points to 0",0
1203_pythondev_2019,Bethany,So it's symmetric matrix if that's always the case; Or undirected,0
1203_pythondev_2019,Lynelle,I could see using a dict of 1d arrays; kind of like an adjacency list,0
1203_pythondev_2019,Bethany,"Also, if you know how many nodes exist ahead of time, or even a guess you can always pre-allocate",0

1340_pythondev_2019,Sasha,`continue`,2
1340_pythondev_2019,Marla,you could use `continue` inside of an `if` `else` clause,2

1706_pythondev_2019,Eliana,if that really exists that sounds crazy awesome. you could use django’s admin interface to do something like that i imagine.; i haven’t heard of a drop in type of thing. sounds difficult as each cell would need to do some backend (ajax) request.,2

1883_pythondev_2019,Frankie,"hmmm I hadn't tried that but yeah I'll look at the instance itself.; maybe it's using something I haven't seen in the roles; as a side note, any idea how I can at least run the command on the EC2 instance itself from the command line soI don't have to keep redeploying?; it seems just running `python manage.py export_user_data` after activating the env and stuff can't create the file on the EC2 instance; it creates the file when using the container command but I can't do it manually and when I use sudo it gives me a syntax error. lol",0

1883_pythondev_2019,Bethany,what happens if you don't sudo,0
1883_pythondev_2019,Frankie,that's the top part; permission denied lol,0
1883_pythondev_2019,Bethany,this might be a django thing and I'll be no help there; is the csv a local file?,0
1883_pythondev_2019,Frankie,"the export command is supposed to create it locally, yes; basically I want to create the CSV on the EC2 instance, push it to S3, then delete it from EC2; every time I deploy; it works to create it on deployment, but won't push to S3...but when I just try to run the command on the EC2 instance, it won't create the damn file and if I sudo it gives me a syntax error. I'm bout to lose it. lol; so at best all I can do right now is redeploy repeatedly to test it, which is annoying cause it takes like 4 minutes to redeploy just to see it fail so it's taking forever to debug it",0
1883_pythondev_2019,Bethany,"so you provision the thing, then push some data from it to s3? But where does the data come from originally?",0
1883_pythondev_2019,Frankie,the database connected to the thing :slightly_smiling_face:,0
1883_pythondev_2019,Bethany,ok so its db -&gt; django on ec2 -&gt; s3?,0
1883_pythondev_2019,Frankie,yes; I guess really it's more like push code to ec2 -&gt; query RDS (database) -&gt; generate csv on ec2 -&gt; push csv to S3 -&gt; delete csv from EC2,0
1883_pythondev_2019,Bethany,"the ec2 stays around afterwards, right?",0
1883_pythondev_2019,Priscilla,I cant seem to figure out how to populate a dictionary with a user-determined number of keys. nothing i try works :facepalm:,0
1883_pythondev_2019,Frankie,"actually, the EC2 instance will not stick around afterwards; once the code is deployed successfully it will be replaced by the load balancer; that's why I don't just want to store the csv on EC2...its ephemeral",0
1883_pythondev_2019,Bethany,<@Priscilla> what did you try to do?; ok I'm a bit confused. Once deployed the ec2 gets undeployed or does it get put behin ELB with other instances?,0
1883_pythondev_2019,Priscilla,hangon... trying one more thing that just came to mind,0
1883_pythondev_2019,Hiroko,"<@Frankie> the issue seems to be the file doesn't have the necessary system permissions for the management command to access ; That's what the stack trace is telling you with the permission denied bit ; So what perms are attached to the file, and what user:group?",0
1883_pythondev_2019,Frankie,"<@Bethany> so basically what happens is that when I deploy from my local machine, it uploads a zip file to S3...there is an SQS queue listening for that upload (all this is configured by elastic beanstalk btw), when the SQS queue sees the upload, it first (I think) clones the existing instance to maintain uptime, disconnects the EC2 instance from the load balancer, deploys the new app version, and then reattaches it. when it reattaches it after a successful deployment it will have a new IP. then it terminates the cloned instance; assuming you just have a single instance system. How the load balancer is configured determines how many it'll allow to be running at once, but I just have it allow only two (one for prod and one for staging)",0
1883_pythondev_2019,Priscilla,"nope, nothing I try works and this is the only thing I think is close. I tried googling, but found nothing relevant. I am shooting blind here, I don't really know how to implement what i want to do :angry:",0
1883_pythondev_2019,Frankie,<@Hiroko> looks like the perms on the directory I'm trying to create the file in are 755,0
1883_pythondev_2019,Hiroko,"<@Priscilla> you're returning something from the number function but not using it anywhere ; Eg, no variable in main to store the return value",0
1883_pythondev_2019,Bethany,"<@Priscilla> do you want to keep prompting for input and put the result in a dictionary?; what is the key and what is the value. do you want `my_dict = {""user_first_input"": ????}` or `my_dict = {??????? : ""user_first_input""}` and what do you want the ????? to be",0
1883_pythondev_2019,Priscilla,"i would like the user input to the key, because the key is a serial number, and the values will be a list.",0
1883_pythondev_2019,Bethany,and you're storing that list somewhere?,0
1883_pythondev_2019,Priscilla,yes,0
1883_pythondev_2019,Bethany,Ok so you probably have something like:; None,0
1883_pythondev_2019,Priscilla,thats right!,0
1883_pythondev_2019,Bethany,and you want them to pick a list via serial number? Or create this,0
1883_pythondev_2019,Priscilla,"no it will go straight to a CSV with one exception; no wait, I mean it will all be presented to the user, not picked via a serial number",0
1883_pythondev_2019,Hiroko,"<@Frankie> no, what I mean is this:
```line 41, in handle
with open(filename, 'w') as csv:
PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: 'ACTIVE_USERS_20190427_233356.csv'```; that’s in your management command; its trying to open a file it doesn’t have perms for",0
1883_pythondev_2019,Bethany,"<@Priscilla> I'm not quite sure what it is the user is expected to do here. But if you have a dictionary, you can add a key:value pair by simply `d[new_key] = new_value`",0
1883_pythondev_2019,Frankie,<@Hiroko> it's trying to open it with WRITE permissions. the file doesn't exist. the code's trying to create it.,0
1883_pythondev_2019,Hiroko,correct; which suggests the user:group of the process running the command doesn’t have access to that directory,0
1883_pythondev_2019,Frankie,I agree lol; I don't know what that process is though,0
1883_pythondev_2019,Hiroko,"if you ssh into the instance, with the same group, are you able to `touch some_file.txt` in that directory?",0
1883_pythondev_2019,Frankie,"yes, if I sudo, but if I sudo as you can see it gives me a syntax error",0
1883_pythondev_2019,Priscilla,"i know, im sorry <@Bethany> let me explain entirely. The user will input some serial numbers (corresponding to connected devices) but there is no set number, they will connect anywhere from 1-10 devices. Each device will run through some tests and pass or fail and at the end I need to display this:",0
1883_pythondev_2019,Bethany,oh ok and that is saved to csv as a report or something,0
1883_pythondev_2019,Priscilla,right,0
1883_pythondev_2019,Hiroko,then I would suggest you change things so you don’t have to run that command with `sudo`,0
1883_pythondev_2019,Frankie,that's not the issue.,0
1883_pythondev_2019,Bethany,"so it sounds to me you don't actually need a dictionary to store the user input, you could use a list or set",0
1883_pythondev_2019,Frankie,the command runs fine when I deploy the code because the deploy script runs as root; I was just trying to run it locally on EC2 so I didn't have to keep redeploying cause it saves me waiting for 4 damn minutes just to test changing bucket policies 50 times in a row lol,0
1883_pythondev_2019,Priscilla,"yes, but the data does need to be ordered, like explicitly in that order `serialnumber, [test1], [test2], [test3]` arent sets unordered?",0
1883_pythondev_2019,Carmen,"A set is unordered, yes.",0
1883_pythondev_2019,Frankie,<@Priscilla> `from collections import OrderedDict` ftw!,0
1883_pythondev_2019,Hiroko,"well, if you’re using python 3.6+, dicts are ordered by insertion; 3.6 made it an implementation detail, 3.7 finalized it in the spec",0
1883_pythondev_2019,Bethany,"if you need no duplicates but order doesn't matter, `Set`, if you need duplicates and order matters, `list`; <@Hiroko> i thought that was a Cpython implementation detai",0
1883_pythondev_2019,Priscilla,None,0
1883_pythondev_2019,Hiroko,"in 3.6, yes",0
1883_pythondev_2019,Bethany,but it's in the spec now?,0
1883_pythondev_2019,Hiroko,correct,0
1883_pythondev_2019,Bethany,oh cool. Still will probably not assume it though,0
1883_pythondev_2019,Hiroko,&gt;&gt;&gt;the insertion-order preservation nature of dict objects has been declared to be an official part of the Python language spec.; <https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.7.html>,0
1883_pythondev_2019,Priscilla,ok so then lists it is,0
1883_pythondev_2019,Bethany,list is a good default choice anyway.,0
1883_pythondev_2019,Hiroko,"before, it was an implementation detail of cpython, which excludes pypy; but now, its part of the spec",0
1883_pythondev_2019,Priscilla,i think i understand lists a little better than the other options,0
1883_pythondev_2019,Frankie,Maybe I'm missing something cause I was half paying attention to your issue/goal <@Priscilla> but this seems kinda trivial to me...what is your goal for user input and what's the goal for output?; are serialnumber1-4 supposed to be entered by the user?,0
1883_pythondev_2019,Priscilla,"The goal for input is the serial number of a device then running some functions against it and getting back a pass or fail for each 3 set of functions. Then displaying the serial number and 3 test results to the user. Apparently they will do these devices in a single batch of 10. So the amount of devices (serial number and test results in this convo) may not be a definitive number, ya know?; does that make sense?",0

How would one go about setting up a “production” server for python development?

Now we want to start calculating _statistics_ of tennis matches and players, like average points and so forth.

Search by ""greedy"", there are some pointers. Though I'm not 100% sure they are applicable; ``` *?, +?, ??
The '*', '+', and '?' qualifiers are all greedy; they match as much text as possible. Sometimes this behaviour isn’t desired; if the RE &lt;.*&gt; is matched against '&lt;a&gt; b &lt;c&gt;', it will match the entire string, and not just '&lt;a&gt;'. Adding ? after the qualifier makes it perform the match in non-greedy or minimal fashion; as few characters as possible will be matched. Using the RE &lt;.*?&gt; will match only '&lt;a&gt;'.```",0

```match.group(1) #will print everything up until the first token
match.groups() #will print all groups and you can choose the appropriate one```; <@Porter> but i would actually recommend using replace instead like this: ```re.sub('(token1|token2|token3).*$', '', 'here is some text with a token2 in it somewhere and a token1')``` that way it doesnt matter what order your tokens are in",0

And it appears that if I do this reversed list method I get a fixed list that isn't affected by my swapping; For context the problem I'm solving is:
`#Given a sorted array of postiive integers with an empty spot at the end, insert an element in sorted order.`; So I'm starting from the back, and checking if the index is the right place to insert my value. If it isn't, I swap the 0 at the end with the value next to it and continue on.; My output looks like this when I used that reversed list enumerate combo. I get the right answer.. but not the right process. Notice how the 0 disappears.; ```
This is the array: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 0]

`extend`ing a list with a `BarContainer` object works, as does using `+=` (which i just found out is not actually doing the same thing as `extend` to update the list), but creating the list like `some_list = [1, 2] + BarContainer` does not work as it would for `some_list = [1, 2] + [3, 4]`
its easy enough to get around by adding `bars` to the list a line afterwards with either of the first 2 methods, but now im trying to find an answer to this online and am coming up short, for a little more context, i know the difference is between the list calling `__iadd__` or `__add__`, but im not sure why `__add__` would try to add the `BarContainer` whole while `__iadd__` is doing something sneaky to add the individual objects that the container is holding, when they don’t behave differently when using say another list instead of something like `BarContainer`",0

And where it is included, I can see true beginners forgetting it between reading the chapter and actually needing it; And I honestly haven't used null devices a whole lot in my career or personal stuff; You get the occasional command that either inexplicably prints messages on STDERR or has a slightly broken (or missing) --quiet switch; And some scenarios (like that SQL Server one) where you have a process whose entire purpose is file writes or reads, and you just need to execute the process successfully in order to move on",0

The other thing to notice is that you _could_ get clever with `Html.map` to propagate that message up separately, but I don't think there's any real pro's to that.; So if you have different `update` functions, I sort of like to think they can separately decide how to use a `LinkClick` message and translate it to the correct `newUrl` call",2

2503_elmlangG_2017,Gene,"<@Nelly> It's hard to say, it depends on what you consider 'boilerplate'; Routing is the process of converting the url string in to some useful data structure that you can use to identify which view to show, this is done simply using the `evancz/url-parser` package; In the example <https://github.com/evancz/url-parser/blob/master/examples/Example.elm#L45-L51> the actual url matching is only a few lines",2
2503_elmlangG_2017,Irma,"Overall, in Elm we don't have too many things that work in a ""drop it in and it automatically does its thing"" sort of way. There is no code that gets run without it being used in the `program`, which means you do need to wire things into your program code, but also that you can just _read the code_ and understand everything that happens in the application.; In essence, all languages/frameworks balance between being explicit about what is going on (positive) and having to write out tons of stuff to have anything happen (negative). Or the other way around, very little or no own code (positive) and too many things happening in the background to keep in one's head (negative)",2

30_elmlangG_2019,Lynne,"Hey folks. I think I know the answer to my question but there is a chance I am missing something. Say I have a list of rose trees where each node contains an object of the same type. I would like to work with this ""forest"" as if it is a rose tree to use zipper etc. This is easily achievable by catering some root item which would be a non-meaningful value of the same type which all trees are using.

30_elmlangG_2019,Lynne,Not sure I understand. Do you suggest using a type with single constructor where root would be `Root Something &lt;no tree&gt;` and every descendant `Root &lt;nothing&gt; &lt;some tree&gt;`?,0

30_elmlangG_2019,Nery,"another pesky question...
what's the significance of requiring `age` to be defined in record after record
why couldn't age simply be defined as Int w/o marrying it to a record
are there strongly typed PLs that allow stuff like this.
it seems rather silly or redundant to have to keep re-defining `age` across N records as an Int
(i assume haskell makes you do the same thing?)",0
30_elmlangG_2019,Kris,"I don’t understand your question, but you can just write that function as an `Int -&gt; Bool` and call it as `f myRecord.age`; Haskell doesn’t really have records, so nope : p",0
30_elmlangG_2019,Nery,"but what if my logic is based on not just age, eg
`canRideThisRide : Entity -&gt; Bool`
...where in you have to be 10 or older and your height has to be greater than 1.5m, say...; so i have `age`, an Int, and `height`, a Float, say",0
30_elmlangG_2019,Timika,That works the same way as with my example code. You can _match_ on multiple fields.,0
30_elmlangG_2019,Carman,"Are you trying to be super generic here? Or could `Entity` be a record that has all the fields you want:

type alias Entity =
{ age : Int

30_elmlangG_2019,Nery,"ah i like that <@Carman>
would that be acceptable approach or .. an anti-pattern..?",0

canRideThisRide : Entity -&gt; Bool
canRideThisRide entity =
entity.age &gt; 10 &amp;&amp; entity.height &lt; 1.5

30_elmlangG_2019,Nery,i mean that's basically what i'm after <@Carman>; i want to define a _vocabulary_,0
30_elmlangG_2019,Timika,It would become an anti-pattern as soon as you have fields that are not used by all kinds of entities and then get a default value that makes no sense.,0
30_elmlangG_2019,Nery,NOT a taxonomy of types,0
30_elmlangG_2019,Carman,I'd say that's the standard way to design structures. As your business rules get more complex you can get fancier to eliminate impossible states,0
30_elmlangG_2019,Nery,ah <@Timika> that seems a problem; can they just be defaulted to Empty/Null/what-have-you?; Unknown,0
30_elmlangG_2019,Timika,"You could make them `Maybe`s. But I would consider a record with just `Maybe` values an anti-pattern. But as always, you have to make your own trade-offs that make sense to you and the problem you’re trying to solve.",0
30_elmlangG_2019,Nery,yeah i guess my issue is that this seems pretty basic; so i have a sense i'm missing something,0
30_elmlangG_2019,Timika,Could it be that you’re trying to do some game-engine stuff? :slightly_smiling_face:,0
30_elmlangG_2019,Nery,hahaha that would be more fun than what i'm doing; i'm basically just doing business data processing stuff,0
30_elmlangG_2019,Kris,Elm doesn’t have that many language features,0
30_elmlangG_2019,Nery,"like load a bunch of entities and then render them - basic stuff like that; but to be able to just deal w/ facts like ""age"" and ""height"" seems pretty fundamental
so, since Dicts don't really make this natural, it seems _records_ are the way to go
well, more specifically, a _single_ record like Entity seems the way to go; but then having say 100 fields that are all Maybe doesn't sound right
so i feel like i'm stuck between a rock and a hard place",0
30_elmlangG_2019,Carman,It depends on what the business rules of your system are. Are there some combinations of missing/present data that are invalid?,0
30_elmlangG_2019,Nery,"not necessarily or minimally
after all is just to render; so if a fact isn't present then it just doesn't need to render",0
30_elmlangG_2019,Carman,"If all the Maybes are independent, it could be that you're just dealing with highly uncertain data",0
30_elmlangG_2019,Nery,well today it's well-known but i'm worried that as new writers want to come into the data system they'll end up breaking my code if i don't make everything Maybe,0
30_elmlangG_2019,Carman,The compiler will tell them if they need to add a Maybe; If all the values are guaranteed to be there today then I wouldn't bring in Maybe,0
30_elmlangG_2019,Nery,they're serving up from back end code (no elm); if i don't make them Maybe.. they could break me overnight; if only i could freeze time... : ),0
30_elmlangG_2019,Carman,"Elm doesn't trust data that comes from APIs. If you're decoding JSON, it will tell you if the data is not in the right shape",0
30_elmlangG_2019,Timika,That seems to be your core problem. You’re reading data from a source that changes at-will. How could you ever work with data from such a source? This goes way beyond types.,0
30_elmlangG_2019,Nery,"the source has the guarantee that all the facts are of the right type
like age is Int, height is Float, etc...; it just won't guarantee which facts you will get across the board",0
30_elmlangG_2019,Carman,"Ah, so all the facts are optional in the API?",0
30_elmlangG_2019,Nery,i'd say if i didn't make that assumption i'd be making myself unnecessarily brittle and easily breakable; like my customers want access to their data in all cases; like if i only have a guy's first name or last name they want to see that; not only see it if i just have his first or last name only (for example),0
30_elmlangG_2019,Lashawnda,you might want to use a more general data structure then,0
30_elmlangG_2019,Nery,i think that's what i'm looking for @luke; but what is it if it's not a Dict or record(s),0
30_elmlangG_2019,Lashawnda,then it's time to model it with a custom type :slightly_smiling_face:,0
30_elmlangG_2019,Nery,"but how .. i mean i want something like a heterogenous Dict .. is there a good pattern (ie, custom type) to get that kind of data structure?",0
30_elmlangG_2019,Timika,The initial idea with a `Dict` and the custom type that encapsulates different types in one type seems one solution.,0
30_elmlangG_2019,Lashawnda,ah yeah that sounds like a good start,0

762_elmlangG_2019,Yang,"hey everyone .. an architecture question here. I keep having this need in elm to create an an object and a container of objects. I would like to keep them separate. For example i have An Exchange module.. and I want to create a container that will keep a bunch of this Exchanges in a container of some sort. It can be a list or dict or what not. In some projects i done the equivalent of `module Exchange.Container exposing(..` and in others `module Excahges` in the previous case i have the normal folder structure `/Exchange/Container.elm` and in the other one i have `/Main.elm`, `Exchange.elm` and `Exchanges.elm`
The name-spacing works but conceptually is misleading. Is like having the container of exchanges inside the Exchange.. when in fact the Exchange data structure is a child of this container.
On the other hand in big apps having all this Exchange, and Exchanges in the main folder starts feeling clunky.. there are usually many such named data structures that live in containers of some kind.
What are some good ways you people figured out to structure this conceptual parent child relation at module level? Im thinking is possible there is no right answer but maybe someone has a nicer way of dealing with this which is better then mine.; thanks:)",1

1111_elmlangG_2019,Isaiah,"I've seen several different ways of structuring larger applications, but I am not satisfied with any of them so far. Richard's SPA example is okay for a stateless application with mutually exclusive ""pages"", but a stateful one will need to take a different approach. The approach taken by [this game](<https://github.com/Lattyware/massivedecks/blob/master/client/src/MassiveDecks/Scenes/Start.elm>) is not bad. I combined these two approaches for my current application, but I still find it lacking. For example, I don't want to load the actual application until the user is logged in, which means I'll need to create a sum type `type Screen = LoginScreen Login.Model | AppScreen App.Model`, and this continues throughout the application, resulting in many layers of nesting inside of sum types in order to guarantee certain conditions are met. This also avoids the problem where everything is wrapped in `Maybe`, but I still feel like there should be a better way to do it.
For reference, you can find the application I am building here <https://github.com/ericnething/roll2d6-client>. It's ~14k loc right now.
I also considered using a state stack (like in games or iOS) where only the state on the top of the stack gets updated and rendered, which would of course allow me to push/pop different models and swap them out. I noticed in the game linked above, localStorage is used to pass data around between ""pages"", but that creates a global mutable state, which is undesirable.

Elm-css currently performs some checks at runtime (this will be improved once/if the phantom branch is merged) and the hashing used to generate the classes (at each view) can become heavy. At last `Lazy` renders a style node at the DOM level of the lazy call, so you may end with a lot of duplicate style nodes in some cases.
This may not matter though depending of your use case.

For example, at least on the theoretical argument of “making impossible states impossible”, I dont think `Msg`/`Model` combinations are impossible states.; 0 At least in my book, a `Msg` isnt a state. Its not memory that persists over time. It doesnt stay in your application. Its just a fleeting report of something that happened that your application needs to respond to.
1 Its a lot more possible than you might think. `Msg` come from the outside world. You dont know when or where they are coming from. Weird combinations can happen.

update msg mdl =
case ??? of
Authentication message, Authentication model -&gt;

But if I use a Sum of Bools ala:
```
type MsgModelThingMaybe = Auth Bool | Main Bool

1266_elmlangG_2019,Willodean,Ahh; You have numerous invalid cases due to space routing; You are fucked bro; The answer to this problem is injective type families or associated data families; You can do this in Haskell but you are fucked in Elm,0

Turning the function algebra into a Sum seems to be what I'm trying to do but I don't even know what I'm saying too... Ugh... I'm such a tweener right now it's painful.; Clearly you can turn a `a -&gt; b` into a Product ala `(a, b)` but not sure how to then say I only want `(Int, Int) | (Bool, Bool)` and not also `(Int, Bool) | (Bool, Int)`... :confused:; I tried parameterizing the type constructor but that ended up polluting a bunch of shit `type ActionModel a b c d = PageOne a b | PageTwo c d` and didn't seem to do what was in my head.; Plus `PageOne a b` is just another way of saying `(a, b)` anyways so I knew it wasn't right.",0
1266_elmlangG_2019,Willodean,They solve this problem because you can parameterize the second type by the first; Or having them share a type; I meant SPA routing; Consider we have 3 types; A route type; A model type; And a msg type,0

1266_elmlangG_2019,Willodean,Right; Because you want this as the concrete case; `Model 'PageOne`; Not; `Model Route`; To make matters worse you will need to existentialize and deexistentialize to convince the compiler you are right about this; `forall` is an issue,0
1266_elmlangG_2019,Buffy,"I think the intuition of it is starting to make sense in my brain now... in other words, in Elm we're sorta just stuck with the `a x b` Tuple and `Debug.todo` crashing out if a bad case ever gets hit, yeh?

1266_elmlangG_2019,Buffy,Or re-write the thing in something with HKT? Purescript? Does purescript have something like elm-ui? That's the lib that keeps me stuck on elm at the moment?,0
1266_elmlangG_2019,Willodean,"HKT is not the issue; the problem is you need to convince the compiler that unaligned cases are impossible; that means that you need some for of dependent typing; where the type of the function can be determined by the value of its input; PureScript cannot do this either, unless they added existentials recently; haskell can only barely do this; and even then, its not ergonomic; the truth is you are running down the type level road, and that road lies maddness; you can invest hours upon hours of effort convincing the compiler this wont happen, and in practice have eliminated ZERO bugs",0
1266_elmlangG_2019,Buffy,"Yeh, I get the picture. So for now, just `Debug.todo` then upgrade that to something to track if the app ever hits any of these cases... maybe by then something else will exist that handles this sort of thing nicer?",0

Once an item is clicked, a new url is pushed displaying a new view with some additional information. When clicking the browser back button I see the list view again but now all filter settings are back to default settings which is not desirable.
*A solution?*
I have experimented with not pushing a new url, instead routing messages through the list view which will keep the state of the list view. However the url is not updated to reflect that we are viewing a subview and there is no url history recorded so clicking the back button will jump to the page displayed before the list view.
*Question*
Are there any idiomatic ways of solving this type of problems in SPAs in general and Elm in particular? Maybe I’m going about things the wrong way or my thinking of how the list view / subview relation should work is backwards.",1
1582_elmlangG_2019,Alicia,<@Dayle> would it make sense to include the filters as query parameters in the URL? it could have the added benefit of allowing people to share URLs with filters pre-applied,2
1582_elmlangG_2019,Rico,Perhaps `Browser.Navigation.back` might help?,0
1582_elmlangG_2019,Alicia,"another way could be having a “backstack” of previous states, and when someone hits back you pop off the current state to return to the previous one; Android apps do something like that",0
1582_elmlangG_2019,Rico,"I wonder if it might preserve state in a useful way (as opposed to the browser back button, which I guess doesn’t.)",0
1582_elmlangG_2019,Dayle,"yes, adding the filters to the url is a good idea, will have to look into the “backstack”, thanks <@Alicia>!",0
1582_elmlangG_2019,Alicia,"yeah you’d have to have a `List Model` or similar that you store, kinda like people do for undo/redo",0
1582_elmlangG_2019,Dayle,"alright, how do I manipulate the browser url without reloading? Nav.replaceUrl ?; would you say that storing the contents of the list itself in session storage is valid design decision?; quite new to javascript SPA programming so trying to pick up some good habits :slightly_smiling_face:",0
1582_elmlangG_2019,Alicia,"`replaceUrl` will change the URL but not trigger a page load (you do get the updated URL to parse), internally it uses `history.replaceState({}, '', url)`",0
1582_elmlangG_2019,Dayle,"well, I would have to hijack the back button of the browser to prevent it from performing a “proper” back action",0
1582_elmlangG_2019,Alicia,"I think keeping it in session storage is a valid design, we do something similar using `localStorage` as a cache for stuff, we’ve landed on a pattern of having it read-only on the Elm side, so if you want to modify something in the cache you modify it and send it out to `localStorage` which then stores it and sends it back in; with `sessionStorage` only living for the life of that tab it might be easier to keep it in memory in Elm though; like as a `Dict String (List something)` where the key is the ID of the list",0
1582_elmlangG_2019,Dayle,"yes, as long as I keep the state of the list view when viewing the subview that would work ok which is the solution I was experimenting with but then I end up with the browser navigation issue. I could open the subview as a modal on top of the list view and replace the url with the path of the current subview. The only issue then (as I can think of) is that to the user it would make sense to tap the back button to get back to the list view but since there is no history recorded the browser would end up on the page previous to the list view. So question then is, can I hijack the back button to simply close the “modal subview” instead of jumping back in history?",0
1582_elmlangG_2019,Alicia,"you could use `pushUrl` to add a new entry to the browser history, I would probably structure it like
1. Getting to the subview requires clicking a link (normal `a` tag), I would include the current set of filters in the URL I generate
2. Since it was a link it will get routed through `pushUrl` and added to the history
3. Hitting back then would take you out of the subview and to the previous view, you could parse what filters should be applied for it from the URL (maybe something like `/list/12345?startDate=2019-01-01&amp;endDate=2019-02-01&amp;anotherVal=something`)",0

882_elmlangG_2018,Melba,"i'm not entirely sure. basically this is on a panel which has its own update/view/model and all of these are called from a larger view (well, the main view) which is going to render this panel along with everything else",0

The question is whether `balanceMessages` is updated from the same branch of that panel's `update` function, or whether they appear at different times. If it's the former, wrapping the port callback in `requestAnimationFrame` will suffice. If it's the latter and multiple calls to `update` occur to (a) update the model and (b) trigger `balancesMessages`, you'll need something like what <@Genaro> posted to ""wait"" for the DOM element to appear (or, alternatively, use mutation observers in JS)",0

3361_elmlangG_2018,Tessie,"Yes. It's particularly nice when you need to differentiate between emails that have been validated and emails that are raw user input; for example in a wizard flow you might have:
```
type Wizard

10| }
You probably need to change the declaration to something like this:
type Collection id rec comparable = ...
Why? Well, imagine one `Collection` where `comparable` is an Int and another
where it is a Bool. When we explicitly list the type variables, the type checker
can see that they are actually different types.

3397_elmlangG_2018,Donald,Does anyone have any resources or strategies they found especially helpful for _learning to read and understand error messages_? I’ve found that some of my colleagues get particularly tripped up with error messages that involve _functions as parameters_ or _type variables_. The response is often “oh that didn’t work; let’s try this way” without understanding _why it didn’t work_. I’m wondering how someone would go about practicing that skill.,1
3397_elmlangG_2018,Estrella,"Funny enough, I'm teaching someone Elm right now, and types/type signatures were definitely a sticking point. First, tagged unions (aka custom types) are a little mind boggling on their own. But more importantly, knowing how to _fit type signatures together_, like calling a function a passing the result to another function, was also difficult at first.
Disclaimer: this is his first real programming language, so no prior knowledge of types; I would love a ""game"" where the goal is to learn types. It's like a puzzle: _How can you compose these functions?_ _Write a function that fits between these other two functions_, etc; That also involves knowing the type of a value. What is the type of `1`? How about `Just`? How about `myWeirdFunction`? (Finding the definition or using editor plugins to read the type signature is important too); Errr, to actually answer your question, I don't have a particular resource, but just practicing writing real programs has been helpful.",2
3397_elmlangG_2018,Rich,The error messages the Elm compiler produces tend to be really helpful but people have become used to largely ignoring compiler errors because most languages don't have good error messages.; If you can get your colleagues to trust and carefully read the entire compiler error message they'll be in a much better position. But reading compiler error messages requires having a good understanding of how to read types. So practicing reading types is the most useful thing to do.,2

The only thing that looks unusual to me in the example is having the variable name on the same line as the `let` but then the definition is to the _left_ of the name in the next line.

10997_irc_angularjs,robdubya,nickeddy i would set the results in the service,0
10997_irc_angularjs,nickeddy,robdubya: because I need to be able to call that filtering function on that so several references to that data get updated,0

11694_irc_angularjs,oste,what is the proper way to call a dynamic function in a directive?; i was hoping scope.eval(attrs.changeFunction);; but i am getting undefined is not a function,1
11694_irc_angularjs,tuhoojabotti,dynamic function?,0
11694_irc_angularjs,oste,i was hoping that would call $scope.function();; the function is defined in the view as an attribute; i need to execute that on the scope in the directive,0
11694_irc_angularjs,tuhoojabotti,oste: put it in the attribute like this: function(),0
11694_irc_angularjs,oste,yes that is what i do,0
11694_irc_angularjs,tuhoojabotti,Ah,0
11694_irc_angularjs,oste,so it is a string in th directive,0
11694_irc_angularjs,tuhoojabotti,"oste: You're making your own directive with the attribute, right?",0
11694_irc_angularjs,oste,tuhoojabotti yes; and the attribute should be a function that needs to be called on the scope,0
11694_irc_angularjs,tuhoojabotti,Yeah,0
11694_irc_angularjs,oste,thought eval would work...; from the docs... Executes the expression on the current scope and returns the result,2
11694_irc_angularjs,tuhoojabotti,"oste: add it to scope object; function: '&amp;'; Then you can use $scope.function, I think",2
11694_irc_angularjs,oste,add it to scope object?,0
11694_irc_angularjs,tuhoojabotti,"oste: in the directive constructor; return { restrict, require, scope, controller, ...}; there scope: { 'yourFunc': '&amp;' }; it binds $scope.yourFunc to the attribute",0
11694_irc_angularjs,oste,hrm - not sure that is what i need but will take a look,0
11694_irc_angularjs,tuhoojabotti,"oste: scroll down to scope: <a href=""https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/%24compile"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$compile</a>",0
11694_irc_angularjs,oste,i am using link:; inside of there if i just call scope.blah(dateForm);; it works and calls the parent controller blah function,0
11694_irc_angularjs,tuhoojabotti,Yeah,0
11694_irc_angularjs,oste,just need to call that via the attribute i guess; scope.attrs.changeFunction; scope[attrs.changeFunction],0
11694_irc_angularjs,tuhoojabotti,"oste: You shouldn't do that yourself, let angular bind the attribute to a function you can call.",0
11694_irc_angularjs,oste,that works w/o params; oh ok,0
11694_irc_angularjs,tuhoojabotti,"add before link, scope: { changeFunction: '&amp;' }; then you can do $scope.changeFunction('param1'); no",0
11694_irc_angularjs,oste,changeFunction could be anything...; that is why it is an attribute,0
11694_irc_angularjs,tuhoojabotti,sorry {'param': value}; Yes; that's how it works; if it's '{count + 1}' then it would be $scope.changeFunction({count: 2}); it would output 3; same for 'myOtherFunction(count)' would call that with count as 2.,0

11694_irc_angularjs,oste,no sir; looking at the directive guide too; i dont think defining the method in my directive is correct; the user can define any method name; and it will get called from within the directive; they define the method name in the directive attribute,0
11694_irc_angularjs,tuhoojabotti,"oste: It's quite simple. &lt;my attrName=""anyName(bar)""> then in the directive return { scope: { change: '&amp;attrName' }, ... } then in the scope $scope.change({bar: 'somevalue'}); It can be any name.; bar can be in the parent scope, it doesn't need to be declared in the function call to change.",0
11694_irc_angularjs,oste,ok now we are cooking with peanut oil; does this work with link: as well?; i dont want to return scope i dont think,0
11694_irc_angularjs,tuhoojabotti,No,0
11694_irc_angularjs,oste,oh wait...,0
11694_irc_angularjs,tuhoojabotti,You need scope and link,0
11694_irc_angularjs,oste,yeah,0

11694_irc_angularjs,tuhoojabotti,it can be any name for the function you want; if it's the same as the attribute name then name: '&amp;' is enough,0
11694_irc_angularjs,oste,awesome i think i have it; $scope.change({bar: 'somevalue'}); i think it can only be $scope.change();,0
11694_irc_angularjs,tuhoojabotti,It can,0

13141_irc_angularjs,leehambley,"FesterCluck, fair enough - frustrating not to be able to use promises in my views, I added service wrappers to my objects, to get their children, etc, and obviously promise unwrapping in the views is deprecated now",0
13141_irc_angularjs,FesterCluck,"leehambley, Have your services injected into controllers, and add the values directly to scope",2
13141_irc_angularjs,leehambley,"FesterCluck, that's what I'm doing, but it only works for one level of nesting, perhaps teh answer is to have nested controllers",0
13141_irc_angularjs,FesterCluck,"leehambley, Ah, I see. I have a good implementation for you, but it requires ES6 proxies",0
13141_irc_angularjs,leehambley,"but I have views of [projects [lists [comments] ] ], and having projectLists on $scope is OK, but then the 3rd level of nesting makes things a bit unruly; FesterCluck, i'd be glad of some reading material :)",0

13141_irc_angularjs,leehambley,"FesterCluck, typically I'm resolving the master list in the routeProvider resolver, and then for each object in the list, there's something like project: { lists: function(){ ListService.for(this) }}; where lists() returns a promise, not the $http promise, but a wrapped one; so it really returns List items ^; rather than data/etc",0
13141_irc_angularjs,FesterCluck,"leehambley, Ok, so here's the deal. You're returning a wrapped Promise as to combine the final data object and the Promise itself, so it's like a self-resolving entity, yeah?",0
13141_irc_angularjs,leehambley,"no, literally a list of projects like [{ lists: function() { ListService.getListsForProject(...)},}]; so the promise doesn't modify the ""parent"" when it resolves; it just yields the appropriate list of lists (excuse shit naming of my domain objects)",0

That's for the repeat function to enumerate a scope variable, and for the service to add the return value to the scope. Angular's binding will handle telling the view to render from that point, instead of blocking; leehambley, I see no need for any of these things to modify their parents",0
13141_irc_angularjs,leehambley,"FesterCluck, I did think about making `lists()` be called getLists() and have that add object.lists as a property, with a sane default; I've been doing: (excuse hte inline code); $scope.$watch('project', function(newProject){; newProject.organization().then(function(organization){ $scope.organization = organization; });; and, the same for lsits, except on $scope.projectLists[project] = newLists",0

13141_irc_angularjs,FesterCluck,"leehambley, I gotcha, so Im a bit lost, do you still need help? Your data services basically need to add individual promises to an array which is wrapped by a single $q.all.

15145_irc_angularjs,Blazedd,I'm relatively new to angular and I'm used to dealing with raw js or jQuery where you KNOW what element has fired an event at the callback.; I'll look into what a dirrective might do for me.,0
15145_irc_angularjs,Stephen,"a directive would help you tons; Typically events are NOT the way to go in angular, but I can't speak for every situation; Angular works through references to a common variable in scope, and using the binding functionality",0

15145_irc_angularjs,Zerot,"Blazedd: well, in this case you could have multiple solutions depending on what is needed. if you just need a simple visual active then a simple directive works, but if the active is needed for something else you could do a simple combination of ng-active and ng-click where ng-click sets the active state in an array; Blazedd: e.g. ng-click=""state[$index] = !state[$index]"" ng-class=""{active: state[$index]}""",0
15145_irc_angularjs,Blazedd,"Zerot, setting active was just a single part of the whole problem. There's a bit more behind why I need the element.; I think I've got it from here",0

19400_irc_angularjs,angularnewbie,Foxandxss hmm ok,0
19505_irc_angularjs,dweave,hi folks is there a good way to hold a copy of a scope in a service,1
19505_irc_angularjs,davek,"Yes, angular.copy(service.property, $scope).; Is a good idea? Hell no.",2
19505_irc_angularjs,dweave,not a good idea?,0
19505_irc_angularjs,davek,Needing to copy your entire scope into your service is generally an indication that your design is faulty somewhere. Why does your service need access to the entire scope?,0
19505_irc_angularjs,dweave,davek: im looking for a way to maintain the state of a tree view when navigating away and back to it (by state I mean which nodes are open),0
19505_irc_angularjs,wafflejock,dweave: you should be going the other way around,0
19505_irc_angularjs,dweave,wafflejock: how so?,0
19505_irc_angularjs,wafflejock,dweave: the service should have the model that needs to persist and that should be referenced from the controller,0
19505_irc_angularjs,davek,"dweave, so generate a state object on exit and cache that in localStorage/your service then have the scope first check the service for the state object when setting up.; If the state object is found, recreate the state encoded in it. If it's not, set up the default state.",0
19505_irc_angularjs,dweave,so what would be the disadvantage of maintaining a copy of that scope somewhere. seems like it would already have all the state in it,0
19505_irc_angularjs,davek,"dweave, yeah and all the functions with out of scope closures and indeterminable side-effects. Exactly.",0
19505_irc_angularjs,jaawerth,"dweave: You can create a service to hold the state of your $scope, but it's best to go service--&gt; scope rather than scope--> service for maintainability reasons. if you do $scope.menuState = service.menuState where menuState is { state1: val1, state2, val2 } then it will pass by reference and stay bound when you browser back to the menu",2
19505_irc_angularjs,wafflejock,"dweave: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17667455/angular-http-vs-service-vs-ngresource/17668516#17668516"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17667455/angular-http-vs-service-vs-ngresource/17668516#17668516</a> just to show an example of what Jaawerth is saying",0
19505_irc_angularjs,jaawerth,hmmm I'm trying to think of any reason why $emitting from the link function wouldn't work if it works from the controller; as long as you're still doing it on scope,0
19505_irc_angularjs,wafflejock,jaawerth: yeah confused too; was scanning compile src but it's dense and long,0
19505_irc_angularjs,jaawerth,"either way, if you want to communicate well between directives, using a shared 'required' controller is probably better",0
19558_irc_angularjs,lenswipe,hey guys; can someone point me in the way of an angular library that does simple tabs that isn't angular-ui ?,1
19558_irc_angularjs,airtonix,lenswipe: tabs are pretty much two or three directives.; lenswipe: in fact there is an example in the documentation for directives,0

19558_irc_angularjs,airtonix,lenswipe: well yes.,0
19558_irc_angularjs,lenswipe,"airtonix, lovely - do you have a link? all the ones i can find are angular-ui/bootstrap",0

19558_irc_angularjs,lenswipe,"airtonix, on the page onw; airtonix, there's some example directive code, is that what you meant?",0
19558_irc_angularjs,airtonix,lenswipe: in fact there is an example in the documentation for directives; lenswipe: tabs are pretty much two or three directives.; lenswipe: the angular documentation?,0
19558_irc_angularjs,lenswipe,yes,0
19558_irc_angularjs,airtonix,i'm just repeating it again for you.,0
19558_irc_angularjs,lenswipe,yes and its not helping; if i want repetition ill write a for loop :p,0
19558_irc_angularjs,airtonix,lenswipe: then i suggest you spend more time learning how directives and communicating between directives work.,0
19558_irc_angularjs,stephen,"lenswipe, Tabs can be accomplished via using a common directive scope across multiple elements and using ng-class (or ng-show) properly",0
19558_irc_angularjs,lenswipe,"airtonix, I'm on this page: <a href=""https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/directive"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/directive</a> at the end there is some example code. Is that what you mean? Yes. or. No. ?; stephen, didn't think of that, excellent point, thank you!; stephen, the only thing is that each tab needs a variable to set to true or false to show or hide the pane, no?",0
19558_irc_angularjs,stephen,"lenswipe, or, you need a single variable which represents the open tab, and each tab would have an expression inside it's ng-show/ng-class; ng-show=""openTab==3""; ng-click=""setOpenTab(3)""; though having the tab's identifier like that inline with the element probably isn't the best idea if you need a dynamic number of tabs; and angular doesn't support dynamic ids; hmm",0
19558_irc_angularjs,lenswipe,"stephen, oh yeah, good point",0
19558_irc_angularjs,stephen,Anyone know if there are any other special objects in expressions besides $event?,0

19558_irc_angularjs,stephen,"wafflejock, so, typically, an element's onclick handler would be good with ""this.id"" returning the element's id. Im thinking about the equivalent in an ng-show or ng-click",0
19558_irc_angularjs,lenswipe,"wafflejock, yeah - trying to make tabs with angular but without using angular-ui; wafflejock, any ideas?",0
19558_irc_angularjs,wafflejock,"lenswipe: think airtonix was referring to this example from the docs <a href=""http://plnkr.co/edit/05gZt8uitEHc4jeTUqjO?p=preview"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://plnkr.co/edit/05gZt8uitEHc4jeTUqjO?p=preview</a>",0
19558_irc_angularjs,stephen,"lenswipe: you'd want something like ng-show=""openTab===element.id""",0
19558_irc_angularjs,wafflejock,"lenswipe: it's on the directive page under ""directive to directive communication"" it's not styled but shows how to make two directives a tab and a pane that communicate with each other",0
19558_irc_angularjs,lenswipe,"wafflejock, I did wonder - but he wouldn't say",0
19558_irc_angularjs,stephen,lenswipe: That would get you a repeatable element to create,0
19558_irc_angularjs,wafflejock,lenswipe: hehe yeah it seemed like a weird conversation I couldn't follow in reading it back; stephen: you don't want to rely on elements ids within the controller at all and typically you can drive everything just based on the model you create and attach to the scope,0
19558_irc_angularjs,lenswipe,"stephen, the tabs aren't coming from a db, but i want something that i can create more of by just throwing HTML at the page - basically i want to build bootstrap tabs, but without the rest of bootstrap; stephen, ding ding - we have a winner; stephen, does it Grunt too? ;)",0
19558_irc_angularjs,stephen,"lenswipe, suggest not to use id, use some other custom attribute, wafflejock is right",0

19558_irc_angularjs,stephen,"lenswipe, The directive could find all elements with a specific class on them which marks them as ""tab"" and ""tab content"", and generate the identifying property dynamically",0
19558_irc_angularjs,lenswipe,"stephen, forgive me, but how would one do that?",0
19558_irc_angularjs,stephen,"make sure you also have an attribute to link tab to tab-content, or some sort of DOM placement requirementy",0
19558_irc_angularjs,lenswipe,"i dont follow; stephen, wait, no i do",0
19558_irc_angularjs,davek,"For hierarchical relations like this its better to have the child directive specify ""require: ^parent""",0

19558_irc_angularjs,lenswipe,"stephen, you mean like &lt;a href="""" data-showthingy=""mytabcontent""&gt;Foo&lt;/a>",0
19558_irc_angularjs,davek,"That gives you access to the parent's controller in the link function. You then simply use a function on that controller to register the tab, etc.",0
19558_irc_angularjs,stephen,"lenswipe: Let's assume it would be done with css classes. The tab elements would all get a ""tab"" class, the content ""tab-content"" class. Each tab would be the immediate sibling of it's tab-content",0
19558_irc_angularjs,lenswipe,"wafflejock, nothing, although it would be real nice if it didn't have templates in (Im trying make this as search engine friendly as possible)",0
19558_irc_angularjs,stephen,lenswipe: In this case all your tabs and content would be enclosed in a parent element which the directive is on,0
19558_irc_angularjs,wafflejock,lenswipe: only way it's going to be search engine friendly is by preprocessing using PhantomJS or the like; lenswipe: don't architect your code based on SEO there are other solutions,0

19558_irc_angularjs,lenswipe,yeah but it again comes down to having angular do rendering; which I'm not fond of; not right at this point anyway,0

23231_irc_angularjs,wafflejock_,"ingu5: well how I'm imagining it the action=""theendpoint.php"" where theendpoint.php is the location where you were previously making the $http request that returns an HTML response according to the POST parameters, then the inputs for the form have names/values that correspond to the properties/values of the object you are posting via $http right now",0

23231_irc_angularjs,Cixis,renlord: some times; well no; actually,0
23231_irc_angularjs,wafflejock_,ingu5: typically the JSON response would just tell me what happened for that request and the application would already have the information needed to load the appropriate URL based on the response (or perhaps it gets the URL in the response); ingu5: I wouldn't typically try to smash the HTML into the response and then feed that to the browser since things just aren't setup to work that way,0
23231_irc_angularjs,Cixis,that's an interesting perspective; considering angular will load templates via xhr and do exactly that,0
23231_irc_angularjs,robdubya,Cixis html templates != html,0
23231_irc_angularjs,Cixis,effectively they are,0

24991_irc_angularjs,Bade,how so robdubya?,0

24991_irc_angularjs,robdubya,"assuming you get a 401/403 back wen the session expires, easiest way is to use an interceptor; (from which you can trigger the modal)",2

24991_irc_angularjs,wafflejock,Bade: using ui-router or ngRoute?,0
24991_irc_angularjs,Bade,ngRoute wafflejock,0
24991_irc_angularjs,wafflejock,So the user clicks some link which causes a state change then some request is fired off and you receive a 419 and the interceptor shows the modal? can you explain what happens when the route doesn't change?,0
24991_irc_angularjs,Bade,"wafflejock, the screen goes white",0
24991_irc_angularjs,wafflejock,I mean is the request that has a 419 in the state resolve or is the reqeuest coming from a call from a controller to a service or something like that?,0
24991_irc_angularjs,Bade,"It's as if it's stuck between routes waiting for something to resolve.; I do have a route Resolve, and that is what is prompting the 419 to come from the server.; Do I need to call the resolve function again?",0
24991_irc_angularjs,wafflejock,"Bade: okay so you have resolve: properties setup for your states, if one of those doesn't resolve your going to get a routeChangeError event so you'll need to retrigger what's going on in the resolve; it won't create the controller if one of those is rejected (think it doesn't show the template either till that's done)",0
24991_irc_angularjs,Bade,"wafflejock, i'm not following what you're referring to as states. I wasn't aware that ngRoute had states.",0
24991_irc_angularjs,wafflejock,I guess you'd want to save the info about what route was being loaded if you get that error event and then just call that route again after login; Bade: sorry meant routes,0
24991_irc_angularjs,Bade,ok,0
24991_irc_angularjs,wafflejock,was thinking in ui-router terms but same deal,0
24991_irc_angularjs,Bade,"so the routeChangeError, is that detected within my responseError interceptor?; or I suppose routeChangeError would be an event I listen for, similar to routeChangeSuccess or whatever it is i'm using.",0
24991_irc_angularjs,wafflejock,unfortunately I don't think they will be together really you'd be listening for the routeChangeError on; yeah; you can also move the calls to get initial data into the controller but you'd still need to deal with storing whatever request failed and re-runnig it; mmm waffles; for some reason there are a lot of waffle based handles out there... something about geeks and waffles I guess,0
24991_irc_angularjs,Bade,"wafflejock, ok. so I suppose this will only be an issue for route changes. But ajax calls should be fine following this same flow.",0
24991_irc_angularjs,wafflejock,"Bade: yeah you'll still need to store whatever failed and get it to re-run, the only real complication I see here is how to get that data into the appropriate controller or wherever it needs to be when you're going to re-run the request",0
24991_irc_angularjs,Bade,hmmm,0
24991_irc_angularjs,wafflejock,ordinarily I have my requests handled in a service that would update an object that is then referenced from the controllers so I would think I'd want the service method that made the $http call to be called again really not just to make the same $http call... not sure how you would get around that part; maybe easier to just store the route that was attempting to be resolved and just reload or go to it again,0
24991_irc_angularjs,Bade,wafflejock that is a good options,0
24991_irc_angularjs,wafflejock,"Bade: cool if you're still around when you get it done let me know how it goes, current app I'm working on they just redirect to login and you end up back on the landing page but this would be good to implement to avoid pulling the user out of their current view",0

27892_irc_angularjs,Stephen,"peey, But yes, tElement.offsetWidth will get you there in the directive. Hell, you could put a $watch on it.; To actually watch that property, you have to access the DOM element every time",0

27892_irc_angularjs,peey,"wafflejock, that's one good option that requires lot of media queries :D",0

27892_irc_angularjs,wafflejock,peey: yeah just to be aware when someone resizes the window by dragging the edge you're going to get a ton of resize events so you probably want to _.throttle or something similar,0

27892_irc_angularjs,wafflejock,"reduce: sounds strange I don't think I've seen that behavior but yeah grab the nginspector plugin it's a nice alternative to batarang for seeing which elements create which scopes and what functions and models they expose; guy rev087 in the chat here developed it for safari initially but made it a chrome plugin too; ng inspector kind of takes the opposite approach from Batarang it lets you view the entire scope hierarchy and floating over the various scopes highlights the element in the DOM the scope applies to; use the little arrows on the left of a model to expand it to see elements in an array or object, double click and other things doesn't seem to do it for me; yeah apparently I helped him build it but just answer questions no hands on; answered*; haha just listening to a Node podcast guy was just talking about gateway drugs (referring to using grunt/gulp getting people into Node) but kept saying getaway drugs",0

27892_irc_angularjs,wafflejock,yeah splice should modify the original array; I think slice returns a new one; I have to look it up every time; reduce: are you modifying the array in response to some third party thing not done in ng-click or $http or $timeout or some other angular built-in that calls $apply for you to trigger a $digest and update all the $watchers,0

27892_irc_angularjs,oniijin,"yeah; wrap it; dont be a fool, wrap your tool",0
27892_irc_angularjs,wafflejock,haha; sound advice all around; reduce: nope you can wrap the function call in $scope.$apply() to have angular wrap it up to handle errors; reduce: if you just call $scope.$apply() afterwards angular won't catch the error,0

31777_irc_angularjs,pushp0p,ok so I have a controller which continually polls a backend service through an angular service. I want the information that it receives to be sent to another controller if the information changes. Should I use events for this?; hey guys what's a good way to have one service propagate changes in backend data to other controllers and such? Should I have the dependent controllers watch the data or should I send events that trickle down?,1
31777_irc_angularjs,robdubya,"pushp0p just have one instance of each thing, then you can just update teh object. no events necessary",2
31777_irc_angularjs,pushp0p,"robdubya: so I have one controller continually polling some backend data (the backend data has a collection of things, one of which another controller/service combo needs to know in order to fetch its own data)",0
31777_irc_angularjs,robdubya,"pushp0p the idea is that you should only ever have one instance of an object. that way, when changes come in, you can update the object, and it will update everywhre its used",2
31777_irc_angularjs,pushp0p,"robdubya: the only issue is that when updated information comes in I need this dependent controller to start polling something different; robdubya: I'm polling backend route A and when its information changes, I need that to cause a different controller to change what backend route it is polling for updates",0
31777_irc_angularjs,robdubya,controllers shouldn't be polling backends; services should,0
31777_irc_angularjs,pushp0p,"well I mean its polling it through the use of a service; should i set the service to constantly poll instead?; I saw a bunch of articles that had the polling in a controller, so I did it that way",0

31777_irc_angularjs,pushp0p,"i've used socket.io before; robdubya: do you think it would be simpler if the service itself was doing the polling, and dependent controllers/services would just dependency inject it and perhaps watch attributes on the service?",0
31777_irc_angularjs,robdubya,pushp0p you don't need to watch anything; that's what i'm saying; 1 - fetch objects from server; 2 - store them in service; 3 - return them to controller; 4 - poll,0
31777_irc_angularjs,pushp0p,"i mean the only problem is that once the value changes, another thing that is polling has to change what it is polling",0

33352_irc_angularjs,cboden,what is the best practice for working with 3rd party libraries that have UI impacts but not by manipulating the DOM? Directives dont seem to quite fit and putting it in a controller feels dirty as well.,1
33352_irc_angularjs,robdubya,cboden depends on the lib,0
33352_irc_angularjs,sacho_,"cboden, a combination of a directive and service is probably what you want",2
33352_irc_angularjs,cboden,robdubya sacho_ any example/article of anything do this?,0
33352_irc_angularjs,robdubya,cboden what's the lib,0
33352_irc_angularjs,sacho_,"cboden, it's much easier to give an example with a specific lib.",0
33352_irc_angularjs,cboden,"robdubya sacho_: Im using a couple. Google Maps, Highcharts, etc.....Im using a directive to place the element on the page (all is well) but then I need very specific logic to interact with it. Putting it in the directive is too-specific, passing oodles of variables through $scope feels unecessarily complicated when I need to interact with their JS API and putting everything in a controller feels like breaking concerns",0
33352_irc_angularjs,sacho_,"cboden, yes, use a service for that.; cboden, depending on whether the component is a singleton(like google maps, practically), or you can have multiple components on the page, you might need less/more engineering.; for google maps, I'd just use a service thet wraps all the programmatic functionality you'd want to access. Both the directive, and anyone else, use the service to interact with the library.",2
33352_irc_angularjs,cboden,"sacho_: alrighty Ill give that a go, thanks! Would you happen to have a link of anything doing/demonstrating this? If not I think I can figure it out",0
33352_irc_angularjs,robdubya,"service for API calls, inject service into gmap directive, ???, profit",0
33352_irc_angularjs,sacho_,"not really, I just recently had to work with google maps, and that's what I ended up with.",0
33352_irc_angularjs,robdubya,"cboden there's a few gmaps directives out there; dunno about highcharts, i use d3",0
33352_irc_angularjs,cboden,robdubya: Ive researched them all. With the complicated logic I have I just want to use Googles JS API to do what I need,0
33352_irc_angularjs,sacho_,"cboden, there are some interesting problems to consider, e.g. for example if the directive needs to react to events from the library/your service(for example, you're doing some geocoding, and you want to display the results)",0
33352_irc_angularjs,cboden,"sacho_: yes, youre spot on. Thats involed with what Im doing; Im trying to figure out/visualize the best way to architect this",0
33352_irc_angularjs,robdubya,cboden a service for sure to wrap the API; there's a bit of asnyc loading weirdness to handle; really depends if you're ging to have multiple maps on screen; or if it'll be a singleton type thing,0
33352_irc_angularjs,sacho_,"cboden, well, you basically need some pub/sub mechanism to notify the directive of things the service has done.",0
33352_irc_angularjs,cboden,"Im not planning multiple right now, but Im not restricting myself. I have a directive to place a map on the page and have the map object accessible. I figure I can have this service have a new instance created with the map object passed to its construct",0
33352_irc_angularjs,sacho_,"One way is to initiate all calls to the service through the directive - e.g. when you want to do geocoding *for the directive*, you call its own function(or a function on its controller, same thing), which calls the service, and uses the result.; cboden, another way would be to use data binding via $watch(), but you have to be careful there for the particularities of js data binding.; cboden, at that point, you have to consider things like, ""is it possible something calls my service without my directive's knowledge, but then the directive's things must be updated?""",0
33352_irc_angularjs,cboden,"sacho_: Im trying to avoid $watch for coummunication this way. That was my first attempt while doing communication between *things*. It failed for many reasons; ($watch is good for many things, just not everything and I found this trype of work it didnt fit best)",0

33352_irc_angularjs,cboden,It does,0
33352_irc_angularjs,sacho_,"It's tied to scopes, though.; you can technically use that as well.; see, this would be a good situation where you would pass a scope to a service.; although using some tiny event library might be cleaner.",0
33352_irc_angularjs,cboden,"yeah, and not trigger a digest when not needed",0
33352_irc_angularjs,sacho_,"cboden, about $watch(), I was envisioning something like, $scope.state = Service.getState(); $scope.$watch('state.results', ...); then the service is free to assign things to its internal state object, and you would get notifications for it.",0
33352_irc_angularjs,cboden,"sacho_: Ah, that makes sense. I had done something silly like watch an array of thousands of map markers with the third parameter set to true. Oops ;)",0
33352_irc_angularjs,sacho_,"the problem with $watch() is indeed unneeded $digests, though.; it's fairly useful for events that lead to dom manipulation.",0

33571_irc_angularjs,nicholaswyoung,What's the best way to initialize a service that fires a callback before the app can start?,1

33571_irc_angularjs,nicholaswyoung,"raypulver: I can, but I'm not sure how that fits into the whole app init process.; raypulver: Basically, I need to fetch soundmanager from window, call setup, and when the onready handler fires, allow the app to start up; raypulver: because with SM2, I can only play audio after the onready handler fires. Any suggestions?",0
33571_irc_angularjs,raypulver,im not sure.; the only thing that comes to mind is to try to do it in a run block; that happens on initialization,0
33571_irc_angularjs,nicholaswyoung,raypulver: do you have a link to the docs for run()?,0

33571_irc_angularjs,nicholaswyoung,"I tried setting up the service to return a promise, but that means I need to call promise.then() in the controller each time I want to use it... which kinda sucks.; raypulver: thanks",0
33571_irc_angularjs,raypulver,yeah the woes of async haha; so you are trying to not initialize the app; until the promise is fulfilled?,0
33571_irc_angularjs,stephan48,raypulver: thanks for you help!,0
33571_irc_angularjs,chovy,nicholaswyoung: that's how it works.,0
33571_irc_angularjs,raypulver,stephan48 no problem,0
33571_irc_angularjs,nicholaswyoung,"raypulver: That's exactly it. When the promise is fulfilled, initialize the app and provide the data that was passed to the fulfilled promise.",0
33571_irc_angularjs,raypulver,nicholaswyoung it sounds like ui-router is what you want; you can specify an abstract state with resolve: { promise: Service() }; and then promise becomes injectable to your state controllers; and it doesnt initialize the state until the promises you set to resolve are fulfilled,2
33571_irc_angularjs,nicholaswyoung,"raypulver: wow, I didn't even think of that. I know ui-router pretty well, but I thought it was best to start with basic angular principals",0
33571_irc_angularjs,raypulver,nicholaswyoung have you used resolve before?,0
33571_irc_angularjs,nicholaswyoung,"raypulver: not until now. I don't think I've ever had a need for it; raypulver: Now I'll need the resolved promise to be available in the parent AppCtrl, is this still the best way forward?; raypulver: basically, I'm building a player that will be usable from anywhere in the app",0
33571_irc_angularjs,raypulver,nicholaswyoung: thats what I use abstract states for; when I want a master controller of sorts,0
33571_irc_angularjs,nicholaswyoung,"raypulver: That's exactly what I need. I'll dig into ui-router, and keep plugging along. Thanks for your help!",0
33571_irc_angularjs,raypulver,nicholaswyoung no problem let me know how it turns out,0
33571_irc_angularjs,nicholaswyoung,"raypulver: As it turns out, I can't inject the service directly into config(). I need to investigate how providers work. Do you have any knowledge that might be helpful here?",0
33571_irc_angularjs,wafflejock_,"nicholaswyoung: there's a pretty good write up here for providers <a href=""https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/providers"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/providers</a>",2

33571_irc_angularjs,raypulver,nicholaswyoung yes config runs before run,0
33571_irc_angularjs,nicholaswyoung,"raypulver: So if I built out the provider, like this (<a href=""https://gist.github.com/nicholaswyoung/73e23e94a79e1ab4a8a4)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://gist.github.com/nicholaswyoung/73e23e94a79e1ab4a8a4)</a> how do I go about getting a new instance to pass to resolve?; (re: our earlier convo, with regards to ui.router's resolve param)",0

33571_irc_angularjs,raypulver,"from the way you wrote it, it looks like you resolve it with",0
33571_irc_angularjs,nicholaswyoung,raypulver: I thought providers were required to implement $get. I guess I was wrong,0
33571_irc_angularjs,raypulver,resolve: { sm: function (soundManager) { return soundManager(); }; no you're right; i havent made a provider before myself so im lookin this up myself :p; $get has to return an instance of the actual object,0

33571_irc_angularjs,nicholaswyoung,"the promise returned from the provider should be ready to pass into ui.router's resolve param, as you suggested",0
33571_irc_angularjs,raypulver,set resolve: { sm: function (soundManager) { return soundManager() } }; why do you need a provider though? what are you running in a .config block?; just curious,0
33571_irc_angularjs,nicholaswyoung,"raypulver: I'm just setting up $stateProvider, $urlRouterProvider, etc. As I understand it, each state() takes { resolve: }, which should be an instance of the soundmanager promise, so it's injected into the controller",0
33571_irc_angularjs,raypulver,ohh; the good news is that resolve is injectable; with regular services,0
33571_irc_angularjs,nicholaswyoung,"raypulver: It's exactly what I thought you were suggesting earlier.; I have the soundmanager helper setup as a service, but I couldn't seem to inject it into app.config, where I was setting up the routes",0
33571_irc_angularjs,raypulver,I suggested trying .run to execute code before the application initializes,0
33571_irc_angularjs,nicholaswyoung,"so I went the provider way, which I could pass into config",0
33571_irc_angularjs,raypulver,but using resolve is probably a better way to do it; if you already have a service; do it like this (hang on),0
33571_irc_angularjs,nicholaswyoung,whatever way is the best. this is an app I need to maintain for a long while.,0
33571_irc_angularjs,raypulver,"nicholaswyoung like this: <a href=""https://gist.github.com/raypulver/3354afd66c256c186800"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://gist.github.com/raypulver/3354afd66c256c186800</a>; you can inject regular services into the function you set in a property of resolve; you only need a provider to inject to the whole .config block",0
33571_irc_angularjs,nicholaswyoung,"raypulver: Gotcha.

39799_irc_angularjs,siovene,"Hi, I just read that a common pitfall for Angular beginner, such as myself, is abusing .$on() and .$broadcast(). And guess what, my first two controller already use those! So what is the correct way to have controllers communicate? Perhaps they should not communicate at all? In my case, a controller handles a status text (e.g. ""loading"", ""authenticating"",; ""waiting for gps"") and another handles a ""login"" button. When the app detects that the user is not logged in, I want the login controller to tell the status text controller about it, so the status text can hide itself. What's the correct way to approach this simple problem? Thanks!",1

39799_irc_angularjs,robdubya,"well, presumably (assuming you got it to work w/ my sample code, just from the brwoser) you are probably hitting CORS errors to the node app; youllbelost the problem people usually have with CORS; is that they turn it ""on"" according to their server settings; but that usually doesn't include handling the OPTIONS request; (and that's what different about accessing it direct via the URL, vs from a browser application); there are *two* requests going out",0

39799_irc_angularjs,siovene,ok thanks,0

45872_irc_angularjs,robdubya,patrick99e99 services; that's what they're for; patrick99e99 services are all singletons - they don't get re-init'd like controllers when you inject em; so YourService.someObjects would be the same set of objects regardless of how many times you inject it; and therein lies the true angular way,2

47802_irc_angularjs,pras,"Hi folks, I am a beginner to angularjs and want to know few choices in design to make before kicking off the application. Let me list down one by one.; 1. I want to use ui-router (since it supports partial template/controller loading), and my application is sort of tabbed application. In this case, when i switch tab, my controller gets called each time and within which it makes service call to fetch API.; How can i avoid it and make it a single time execution?; I can ofcourse have some flag to keep track of this. but is there a better way to do it?; 2. If i want to initialize the scope variables completely from backend and not make AJAX calls to fetch the same, what would be suggested way to do it? We are currently using directives and embedding the values in them which binds to scope once the page load inside the controller.",1
47802_irc_angularjs,sacho,"pras, you could make the service cache your data; you could do something like angular.module('yourmodule').value('ViewModel', yourSerializedModelHere) and access it from your app",2
47967_irc_angularjs,areologia,what are some practices for avoid the code smell of excessive function parameters in factory functions? I've not been using Angular for long and I often have situations where I want to inject a lot of crap,1
47967_irc_angularjs,chanced,areologia: reduce complexity by narrowing your scope,2
47967_irc_angularjs,areologia,"e.g., service for logging, service for modal dialog, service for scope, service for xyz..",0
47967_irc_angularjs,edrocks,areologia: do you mean using alot of services?,0
47967_irc_angularjs,areologia,"dependencies in general. I was making up an example.; but yes, often I've had a couple services that tag along for cross-cutting things like logging or animation. I feel like I'm missing something in proper Angular architecture.",0
47967_irc_angularjs,edrocks,you could split your factory up into smaller ones but you still need to put all of them where you needed the original one; and your smaller ones might still need everything,0
47967_irc_angularjs,robdubya,"so you have to do the matching somewhere - its jut a question of if you set it up each time, or encapsulate everything in the directive; areologia as a point of reference, probably 90% of my code exists in services",0
47967_irc_angularjs,areologia,"thanks, ppl",0
47967_irc_angularjs,robdubya,"areologia and one way around excessive injections; is to have meta-services that inject smaller ones; build up a ""stack"" of sorts",0
47967_irc_angularjs,areologia,"robdubya: interesting. is the meta service then like a facade? so, in a controller you would be agnostic to the lower level services?",0
47967_irc_angularjs,robdubya,areologia pretty much.; the point of having lots of small services is testability - so you can mock them out; without impacting the controller (so you dont have to fiddle w/ it to write tests),0
47967_irc_angularjs,areologia,fascinating. thanks!,0
47967_irc_angularjs,robdubya,"soo a basic example might be i have a baseModel factory, that injects $http and my cache factory; then each real model injects the baseModel, extends it; then i just inject models; etc; chanced sup",0
47967_irc_angularjs,chanced,i need to compare two collections and find records that are in one and not the other; the records have unique ids,0
47967_irc_angularjs,calmbird,you need to load them and compare,0
47967_irc_angularjs,chanced,but there are 10k+ records so I don't want to just select the unique ID and handle it server-side; 10k+ records in both collections*,0
47967_irc_angularjs,robdubya,could probably use aggregate API in some form or another,0
47967_irc_angularjs,calmbird,mongodb is not sql database; dont overuse collections,0
47967_irc_angularjs,robdubya,"its the opposite of union, i guess",0
47967_irc_angularjs,chanced,right; i was looking at aggregation but that seems to be more geared toward processing records in a single collection; same for map-reduce,0
47967_irc_angularjs,robdubya,so you have two distinct mongo collections (foos and bars),0
47967_irc_angularjs,chanced,right,0
47967_irc_angularjs,robdubya,"both with the same pk's; eg, both represent the same model?",0
47967_irc_angularjs,chanced,"yep, im dumping data into an import collection",0
47967_irc_angularjs,robdubya,blech.,0
47967_irc_angularjs,chanced,but the source doesn't indicate in any way that data has been removed or added,0
47967_irc_angularjs,robdubya,wouldn't it be faster to do it on the fly (rather than two collecitons); using updateOrCreate or w/e the API is?,0
47967_irc_angularjs,chanced,nope because they dont give me anything to determine new/updated/deleted records,0
47967_irc_angularjs,robdubya,isnt that what the pk does?,0
47967_irc_angularjs,chanced,no created/modded dates and deleted records just vanish,0
47967_irc_angularjs,robdubya,"what's the use case (higher level, i mean)",0
47967_irc_angularjs,chanced,its this damned real estate system; i have to import data from the MLS; so what im doing is taking the 10k+ records and dropping them in the temp collection,0
47967_irc_angularjs,robdubya,so from RETS into your own local cache?,0
47967_irc_angularjs,chanced,yep; because i need to process each record,0
47967_irc_angularjs,robdubya,"so in this case, RETS is the ""truth""; that is, you're not 'syncing'",0
47967_irc_angularjs,chanced,"right, but they would rather me just dump my current data and replace it; i'm opposed to that because it'll result in a lot of 404s given that they just remove properties",0
47967_irc_angularjs,robdubya,so you're pulling from the RETS API? or from some file (csb or etc); *csv,0
47967_irc_angularjs,chanced,rets api,0
47967_irc_angularjs,robdubya,with quickbooks (similar disgusting API) i do it with a stream,0
47967_irc_angularjs,chanced,"+ i have for each property, i have to fetch images and then compare whats on S3; i had a stream; and thats how i was processing everything; which was working fine but unfortunately the process takes too long",0
47967_irc_angularjs,robdubya,input stream from request -&gt; push each record into a backgroudnd queue -&gt; createOrReplace -> profit,0
47967_irc_angularjs,chanced,and has been timing out,0
47967_irc_angularjs,robdubya,"the beauty of the background process (i use kue for this) is that you can immediately ""accept"" the record for processing",0
47967_irc_angularjs,chanced,"right, so i've switched to using a background queue (agenda)",0
47967_irc_angularjs,robdubya,so the request -> reponse part (from the RETS api) is near instant; which eliminates timeous,0
47967_irc_angularjs,chanced,right; but i need that data to remain persistent across the background jobs,0
47967_irc_angularjs,robdubya,"chanced yeah, kue uses redis for that",0
47967_irc_angularjs,chanced,"right, but 10k+ records is a lot for a redis saas",0
47967_irc_angularjs,robdubya,chanced 10k+ records is nothing; its slow when you're locally dev'ing to a SaaS redis; same thing i'm suggesting to chanced,0

47967_irc_angularjs,edrocks,holly crap,0
47967_irc_angularjs,robdubya,"just as a cache/queue mechanism, so it cleans up after itself",0
47967_irc_angularjs,edrocks,thats crazy,0
47967_irc_angularjs,chanced,"if i had more customers, i wouldn't care about the redis cost",0
47967_irc_angularjs,robdubya,cheaper if you manage your own instances on digital ocean by far,0
47967_irc_angularjs,edrocks,or anywhere,0
47967_irc_angularjs,robdubya,but then ... you've gotta manage your own instances,0
47967_irc_angularjs,chanced,but this is for a single customer and they're bucking at the added cost,0
47967_irc_angularjs,robdubya,"chanced setup a dokku droplet, $25/month, its basically your own heroku; <a href=""https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing/</a>",0
47967_irc_angularjs,chanced,robdubya: thanks i'll look into it; i havent tried them before,0
47967_irc_angularjs,robdubya,"2 cores for $20, one for the API, one for the processing side; and dokku is fucking amazing (basically, its heroku built on docker)",0
47967_irc_angularjs,chanced,"yea, i dig their pricing; definitely cheaper than heroku",0
47967_irc_angularjs,robdubya,so you can just spin up a redis instance or a postgres instance or w/e,0
47967_irc_angularjs,edrocks,go with linode if you need more storage,0
47967_irc_angularjs,robdubya,so you can literally just git push dokku master; just like you do on heroku,0
47967_irc_angularjs,chanced,does digital ocean run on ec2?,0
47967_irc_angularjs,robdubya,"i think so; areologia directives are great; but people tend to try to make them do too much; like building entire interfaces out of them; they should typically be (like services) single-purpose and assembled / composed; chanced there's a pre-configured dokku droplet too, so its relatively easy to get up and running; and the people in #docker are 2nd only to #angularjs in terms of being friendly helpful non-dicks to noobs",0
47967_irc_angularjs,chanced,"robdubya: roger that, i'll give it a shot; i was hoping to find a cheaper alt to heroku anyway",0
47967_irc_angularjs,robdubya,chanced just pulling up my QB queue,0
47967_irc_angularjs,chanced,and their pricing is pretty damn stellar,0
47967_irc_angularjs,robdubya,should be more or less the same as what you're doing,0
47967_irc_angularjs,chanced,robdubya: biggest difference is going to be reverse-lookup,0
47967_irc_angularjs,robdubya,how so?,0
47967_irc_angularjs,chanced,that was the primary motivator for me to drop them in a collection; i need to be able to determine which ahve been removed; (from the source),0
47967_irc_angularjs,robdubya,"i'd just mark them as such, really",0
47967_irc_angularjs,chanced,right,0
47967_irc_angularjs,edrocks,just stick a bool on them,0
47967_irc_angularjs,robdubya,yep,0
47967_irc_angularjs,chanced,i get that,0
47967_irc_angularjs,robdubya,QB uses an increment counter of sorts,0
47967_irc_angularjs,chanced,"but if the data isn't coming in from the stream; yea, that was sort of what i was thinking i could do",0
47967_irc_angularjs,robdubya,"so each time you fetch, you +1 them, and then flush out the ones that don't match",0
47967_irc_angularjs,chanced,have an import collection so each import has a unique id,0
47967_irc_angularjs,robdubya,the prolem with 2 collections is inevitably keeping them in sync,0
47967_irc_angularjs,chanced,"at the end, check to see any record that doesnt have that id (as in, hasnt been updated)",0
47967_irc_angularjs,geiregjo,"robdubya: If you have some time, please poke me or something I finishedthe plunker.",0
47967_irc_angularjs,chanced,robdubya: i smoke the import collection on start and end,0
47967_irc_angularjs,robdubya,"because you really have *3* - your two local, and the remote; shit gets nasty quickly",0
47967_irc_angularjs,chanced,"nah, that's why im relying on the import specifically; jobs are assigned based on the record id; when the job runs, it gets pulled and worked on isolation; &amp; then flushed at the end",0
47967_irc_angularjs,robdubya,"that's where i'd be using redis, for sure",0
47967_irc_angularjs,chanced,"right, which is what im doing; well, im using mongo but still",0
47967_irc_angularjs,edrocks,robdubya: do you use redis with mongo?,0
47967_irc_angularjs,robdubya,"postgres, usually",0
47967_irc_angularjs,chanced,id prefer reddis,0
47967_irc_angularjs,robdubya,the thing about redis is you can use the pubsub stuff; so its more evented,0
47967_irc_angularjs,chanced,hmph,0
47967_irc_angularjs,robdubya,and you just have a seperate processor process,0
47967_irc_angularjs,chanced,didn't think about that,0
47967_irc_angularjs,robdubya,listening for those jobs being created,0
47967_irc_angularjs,calmbird,why redis over mongo?,0
47967_irc_angularjs,robdubya,"pubsub calmbird; not for storage, but as a sort of shared RAM",0
47967_irc_angularjs,edrocks,Im using mongo now but I might add redis for a cache layer,0

47967_irc_angularjs,chanced,"<a href=""https://github.com/rschmukler/agenda"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://github.com/rschmukler/agenda</a> is what im using",0
47967_irc_angularjs,robdubya,"so in your API process, you fetch, and create a new job for each record",0
47967_irc_angularjs,chanced,and isnt too shabby,0
47967_irc_angularjs,calmbird,What server using with mongodb?,0
47967_irc_angularjs,robdubya,"and then in another process, you listen for each job and process them (and you can control how many get concurrently processed)",0
47967_irc_angularjs,calmbird,"Im using it with node.js, its prety nice.",0
47967_irc_angularjs,robdubya,so redis acts as a (persistent) buffer,0

47967_irc_angularjs,chanced,ya,0
47967_irc_angularjs,robdubya,at least in this scenario,0
47967_irc_angularjs,chanced,right; newer versions of the standard accept input,0
47967_irc_angularjs,robdubya,and presumably this is a background thing anyway; every 15 minutes sync 'em; or w/e,0
47967_irc_angularjs,chanced,"right, it's being run in the background; right; without crud markers i have it running every 2 hours",0
47967_irc_angularjs,robdubya,"then yeah - 2 node proceses, one on a cron that makes the requests to RETS, and pushes each rec into a kue queue",0
47967_irc_angularjs,chanced,yep,0
47967_irc_angularjs,robdubya,2nd just churns,0
47967_irc_angularjs,chanced,thats what im doing.. or at least will be,0
47967_irc_angularjs,calmbird,edrocks: is this go server using multithreading?,0
47967_irc_angularjs,robdubya,"the nice thing is, when a job is done, it'll clear out the redis rec",0
47967_irc_angularjs,nickeddy,robdubya: just the man i wanted to see,0
47967_irc_angularjs,chanced,right now its a long process that handles it but im moving over to agenda,0
47967_irc_angularjs,edrocks,calmbird: thats basically why they made the language,0
47967_irc_angularjs,robdubya,so that redis server shouldn't ever grow more than 50k+ recs,0
47967_irc_angularjs,chanced,which is where i ran into the problem of identifying the differences,0

48108_irc_angularjs,jaawerth,"smc0045: depends on approach, but one simple approach would be to use ng-include to pull it in as a template (or write a directive to do similar). You could also just grab it with $http.get; smc0045: but if you grab it with http.get, a directive would still be the best way to add it to the page, though you could use just use ng-bind-html to add it to the contents of an element. If you do that, you may need to tell angular not to sanitize it though",2

48704_irc_angularjs,alexw,wafflej0ck got a search box that I want to cancel previous AJAX threads when a new search is entered,0
48704_irc_angularjs,wafflej0ck,alexw: you're better off using something like _.debounce or _.throttle I think; alexw: so you just delay sending the request until a few seconds,2
48704_irc_angularjs,alexw,Mhmmm but the user might change their request again; So I wish to cancel the existing request and focus on the new one,0
48704_irc_angularjs,wafflej0ck,alexw: problem is there are a lot of possible race conditions that happen if you are rapid fire sending requests and cancellations; alexw: like say the cancellation is sent out after the response has already been sent out so the cancel is ineffective,0
48704_irc_angularjs,alexw,Mhmmm - so my other solution was to disable the input / button until we have a response (good or bad),0

48704_irc_angularjs,wafflej0ck,dllama: yeah learning curve initially in angular is pretty steep; dllama: but it gets to be really nice to use once you've got a feel for what to do,0
48704_irc_angularjs,dllama,"my friends make fun of me for never putting my toes in the water, but isntead diving head first; so this is no different; learned to snowboard by following some jackass to a double black first time up lol; survived with minimal injuries :)",0
48704_irc_angularjs,wafflej0ck,yeah I'm typically a fan of the dive in approach but sometimes can get overwhelmed doing that (or break your leg depending on what you're diving into),0

48704_irc_angularjs,wafflej0ck,yup,0
48704_irc_angularjs,dllama,way to be a buzzkill,0
48704_irc_angularjs,eddiemonge,how can i find what function called a function?,0
48704_irc_angularjs,wafflej0ck,eddiemonge: in the stack trace if you already have break point you should see it on the right in the stack trace,0
48704_irc_angularjs,eddiemonge,wafflej0ck: you mean in the call stack?,0
48704_irc_angularjs,wafflej0ck,eddiemonge: yeah should show you the functions that got called to call this function; you can click on them to jump between them; doing it live is easier in the case of anonymous functions,0
48704_irc_angularjs,eddiemonge,"yeah there are two, the function being called and the last line of ui-router: `})(window, window.angular);` fun.",0
48704_irc_angularjs,alexw,wafflej0ck maybe a UUID that is passed back would work better; if the current search UUID in scope does not match the returned UUID then abort the result,0
48704_irc_angularjs,wafflej0ck,alexw: yeah might be better if the latest result could be different for the same input; alexw: is doing client side filtering out of the question?,0
48704_irc_angularjs,alexw,that would happen on client side; i.e.; if the scope UUID does not match the returned uuid,0
48704_irc_angularjs,wafflej0ck,alexw: yeah I follow you on that,0
48704_irc_angularjs,alexw,Then exit out of the ajax result as a new search must have been initated,0
48704_irc_angularjs,wafflej0ck,alexw: just saying returning all the data is just to much data?; too much*; cause if you were just doing client side filtering of the data you don't have to deal with the extra roundtrips and all this extra stuff; if the data set is like megabytes or something though I understand not wanting to transfer that over the wire,0
48704_irc_angularjs,alexw,Not many round trips just trying to prevent the user from making a complete mess :P; but the search result can take up to 20 seconds (govt. system),0
48704_irc_angularjs,wafflej0ck,ah k,0
48704_irc_angularjs,alexw,So then they start clicking and clicking and get multiple responses,0
48704_irc_angularjs,wafflej0ck,"yeah I've worked on similar stuff; we had a filtering screen then a loading screen then results, then live/client side filtering on the results; first part was filtering/search screen really for that kind of stuff though it might be worth it to try and cancel the request the problem is you need an endpoint that handles capturing the cancellation request and I'm not so sure about stopping various SQL servers from running an already processing query; so you'd have to profile all the backend parts to see if it would actually be able to shutdown whatever is doing the majority of the processing to free up resources; alexw: 20s is still a long time too even for govt stuff, we definitely had 1 of those but it was for getting up to date information across like 15 data centers, would definitely see if there's a DBA who can setup/modify the views and stuff to make that perform better, how many rows of data are you actually looking at filtering through?",0
48704_irc_angularjs,alexw,wafflej0ck it's actually looking up company name avaliabluty; The data size is tiny; it's a simple yes/no,0
48704_irc_angularjs,wafflej0ck,"in that case I would transfer it across the wire in one shot and then just filter locally; alexw: looks like 10,000 entries is fine (couple of seconds to transfer across the wire) 100,000 takes some time and would require some loading spinner or something; anything orders of magnitude above that and I would definitely go server side filtering",0

51070_irc_angularjs,Beg,"hey. I'm using socket.io and angular and I'm thinking of using directives to make add / edit / delete entities on a single page. There are several types of entities and they all behave differently so they will use different controllers. The data will be updated in real time with sockets.io and my questions is, is there a best practice to achieve this? routes?; Also, say, I subscribe to /users, should I unsubscribe when changing directive?; socketsio is a library which enables you to push messages to a client; basically, you'd have to send requests to the server and ask for changes if you don't use sockets.io; I'd like to ""spice"" it up a bit and not deliver a traditional boring system; it's relatively easy and doesn't add to much overhead doing it that way; What I want to make is a realtime workflow management system; themime: so that someone watching an overview would be able to see how progress is made",1
51070_irc_angularjs,themime,"well not notifications, but your directive issue",0
51070_irc_angularjs,Beg,"themime: well, my issue is that I can't grasp how javascript and angular would act if, I changed the controller and I had eventhandlers that picked up push messages; themime: imagine having a section for members and another for processes; I don't know if it is feasible to fetch all data for the whole page continously and that is where my doubts and questions come from",0
51070_irc_angularjs,themime,"i just wrote a system that handles notifications, you don't need to have event handlers or to use the broadcast system",0
51070_irc_angularjs,Beg,elaborate,0
51070_irc_angularjs,themime,the directive watches for changes it cares about,0
51070_irc_angularjs,Beg,"Yes, I do understand that, I just make directives that watch data, and I use the push messages to change the data",0
51070_irc_angularjs,themime,automatically most of the time with two way binding; 90% of the time you can avoid $watch and 99.9% of the time you can avoid broadcast $on; ckboii89: how are you loading it? is this an angular question?,0
51070_irc_angularjs,ckboii89,"not really angular per say..; im just referenceing the stylesheet at the top; im just confused why my html is not responding to my custom stylin, i referenced the bootstrap.css file and i made a custom.css file to style my site",0

51070_irc_angularjs,Beg,themime: to recieve the handleNotification call; themime: you have to tell the server you are interested in getting notified right?,0
51070_irc_angularjs,themime,Beg: yes,0
51070_irc_angularjs,Beg,"themime: so, imagine you have a single-page-website, and let's get redicilous and you have 10000x different classes, each is a subsection of the page.",0

51070_irc_angularjs,Beg,"themime: entities, subscription lists, when you said, notification, that notification happends for a class. I don't know how to use the term State in this context.",0
51070_irc_angularjs,themime,"or components that can intermix two create the ""one"" state effectively creating 10,000^whatever crazy power to be some huge collection of possible states; do you mean like a module?",0
51070_irc_angularjs,Beg,yep,0
51070_irc_angularjs,themime,"why do you use the word class? is that how it is reflected in your backend?; oh but i see what you mean. our system is a little more chaotic and im currently merging it with these modern concepts; so thats why you said ""subscribe"" - really you mean a component of the system that cares about notifications",0
51070_irc_angularjs,Beg,"yes, so I am wondering if there is a best practice to handle this; how do you handle subscription / unsubscription in such an application; I wouldn't want to get notified of 10000 things at the same time",0
51070_irc_angularjs,themime,im still working that out myself haha. in my controller i have $scope.notifications = NotificationHub.getNotifications() and im then using that scope variable to render/process/count what that particular controller cares about. i think my next step is to filter them before they get the $scope though; im only dealing with like 50 at a time so im just trying to get something to work first,0
51070_irc_angularjs,Beg,while i'm just observing one,0
51070_irc_angularjs,themime,"your problem though is helping me reframe mine; so heres an idea; notification comes in; you push it to a specific array by class; and in your controller you just get that array it cares about; i mean if youre trying to render 10,000 entities at once thats a little nuts. but keep in mind a controller is destroyed when its no longer active (it being invisible with something like ng-show doesn't count); so if youre only rendering say, 10 at a time",0
51070_irc_angularjs,Beg,"yes, but the socket isnt",0
51070_irc_angularjs,themime,only 10 things are receiving updates,0
51070_irc_angularjs,Beg,so I'd have to destroy the socket at the same time the controller is destroyed,0
51070_irc_angularjs,themime,"no, im confused now. do you only want to receive updates from the currently r endered views so you arn'et receiving every notification?",0
51070_irc_angularjs,Beg,"Yes, I want to view only one thing, but there is a possiblity there are multiple modules that view different things; so, when switching between the modules, I would like to have a nice system to stop listening for what I was just listening to",0
51070_irc_angularjs,themime,that sounds like a state,0
51070_irc_angularjs,Beg,perhaps it's a state then I don't know what state is exactly in angular,0
51070_irc_angularjs,themime,a state in ui-router is really just a pag; page,0
51070_irc_angularjs,Beg,"ah, yes. It's states",0
51070_irc_angularjs,themime,"you could use ui-router to switch between ""the collections of views"", which destroys the $scope variable thats essentially ""listening""; so if you have one view in the module, 1 listener. 10 views in one module = 10 listeners, but then if you switch to another one those 10 are destroyed; you could even pass a session object to the server that stores the current view and only sends notifications about that page",0
51070_irc_angularjs,Beg,"alright, in my head, socket.io isn't destroyed",0

51070_irc_angularjs,themime,"check out what it is in angular; Beg: for instance i have a factory that gets a list of customers if a list doesn't already exist. if a controller needs customers, you can use dependency injection to get access to the factory, get the list (which i cache) and then do whatever it wants; if you change the original list in the factory, your ui will automatically update",0

51070_irc_angularjs,Beg,unsubscribing is important because the server will still push the messages,0

51070_irc_angularjs,Beg,"yes, that's what I mean by subscribe/unsubscribe; subscribe, tells the server, Hey I want to know about Users, also tell me when they are updated; unsubscribe, tells the server, hey I don't want more updates for Users",0

53315_irc_angularjs,seriema,shredjs: I'm thinking no? use a .constant() instead?,0
53315_irc_angularjs,shredjs,like $rootscope.url = localhost:3000 and then in $ressource use url: $rootscope.url + '/Home/Test',0

53315_irc_angularjs,shredjs,Well the url will not only depend on the environment.. ITs because the web api developper will test in his local environment as the frontend developper will only test with the actuall api adress; i would go with with constant,0

58089_irc_angularjs,jaawerth,"wdna: yeah, the use of that $eval is so weird I was just trying to see the POINT of it; wdna: $eval itself shouldn't call scope.$apply, typically.; wdna: question, is apply being set to true for any initController or setMainCategory functions on an angular event like ng-init?; wdna: er, that is ng-click rather; wdna: being $apply should only need to be called on events outside of angular context, like a raw DOM event, a setTimeout, etc; that use of eval is really bizarre... the whole point of the '&amp;' option for isolate scope is that the function/expression is executed in context of the parent scope; haha, weren't you complaining about other people doing that the other day?",0

58089_irc_angularjs,jaawerth,"wdna: I haven't seen it much with $eval, but yeah, it's a common error for people to use $apply all over the place because they don't really have to use it.

58089_irc_angularjs,jaawerth,"wdna: well, the $apply is actually unnecessary when you're in a digest cycle - the main thing about $apply is that it *triggers* a digest (wrapped in some other code) over all your scopes. Usually it's the other way around from what you described - someone does a setTimeout (which will never execute during a digest, because of how the browser event loop works), and you need a digest to be triggered; though usually you'd use the $timeout service instead (which handles that for you), unless you have a specific reason not to; wdna: as a quick fix, you could replace the uses of $apply there with a safeApply. It's not great code, but it will fix that particular issue",0

61271_irc_angularjs,m0,"progrock: for directive to directive communication, one directive exposes the controller which is like an api. And the other directive just requires the directive and through its link function it reads it. There is an example on angular docs on directives at the very end.",2

61271_irc_angularjs,progrock,"jaawerth: yeah, thats my issue.. I know I can pass in a function... but I want the other way, I want the directive to define the funciton",0
61271_irc_angularjs,jaawerth,progrock: but of course that's more for dropping in expressions to execute for things like event listeners. The other thing you could do is mimick the way Angular's &lt;form> directive works,0

23101_irc_opengl,memfr0b,Cheery: You might want to look into the configure script and find out what it does to check for glut.; Usually it's just a check for GL/glut.h (include/compile check) and/or a check for some glut function (link check).,2

23101_irc_opengl,memfr0b,Cheery: You might have to add some include/link path to CFLAGS/LDFLAGS; Cheery: Might also be that the ubuntu freeglut package doesn't provide glut.h but only freeglut.h or something.; So you should check that package as well (dpkg -L).,2

27445_irc_opengl,jkthecjer,"youre right, god i hate messing with this part of the program",0
27445_irc_opengl,EvanR,for a smooth mesh you can share normals; for a set solid mesh you need to have different normals at creases,0

27445_irc_opengl,yosh64,"jkthecjer, yep that would work",0
27445_irc_opengl,jkthecjer,use two models (one smooth and one not) and combine them in-game,0

27445_irc_opengl,jkthecjer,i still have the blender 1.4 manual around somewhere :-),0
27445_irc_opengl,EvanR,if the mesh is smooth ill export the vert normals (saves space); if the mesh is solid i will export face normals; now what about auto smooth?; is the auto smooth info accessible?,0
27445_irc_opengl,yosh64,auto-smooth is for rendering,0
27445_irc_opengl,EvanR,ok so no,0
27445_irc_opengl,yosh64,well I guess you could access auto-smooth data...; anyhows I will try something,0
27445_irc_opengl,EvanR,that would probably make things complicated,0

27445_irc_opengl,EvanR,is the texture data accessible?; image texture,0
27445_irc_opengl,yosh64,"I'm guessing if you split the mesh into groups, then indeed you would have multiple normals for a single vertex",0

27445_irc_opengl,EvanR,the model file needs to start with; name mymodelsname; name tree; so the user must somehow give 'tree' to the exporter or must extract it from filename,0

32426_irc_opengl,MatthiasM,DarkUranium: that's because glutInitWithExit is not part of libglut32.a,0

32426_irc_opengl,DarkUranium,pretty much all; except the physics part,0

32426_irc_opengl,DarkUranium,"besides, SDL is low-level anyways; so by moving directly to GLFW/GLUT/whatever, I won't lose much",0
32426_irc_opengl,lexs,not that lowlevel,0
32426_irc_opengl,DarkUranium,"nope, not THAT low-level",0
32426_irc_opengl,lexs,and glut is kinda limiting with its forced game loop,0

32426_irc_opengl,DarkUranium,but SDL's modules; one of which happens to be sdl_tex... another sdl_ttf; and so on,0
32426_irc_opengl,lexs,im just using sdl for window and input managment,0

34702_irc_opengl,vampirefrog,"what does ""vertex cache"" actually mean?",0
34702_irc_opengl,Burga,"the hardware has a small cache, from 16-64 entries, which caches transformed vertices..; so, if you sort your index buffer bassed on reuse, you can improve vertex performance by quite a bit; assuming you're vertex limited....; but, it can be a win..; and it's always a good idea to reduce all bottlenecks",0
34702_irc_opengl,vampirefrog,"wait, so how does this work, i transform once; and then if i don't change the matrix, the first 64 vertices are already calculated?",0
34702_irc_opengl,Burga,it's post transform..,0
34702_irc_opengl,vampirefrog,hm; I'll have to google about that :),0
34702_irc_opengl,Burga,"well, I'm not sure which state affects it.. but it's more per draw call than anything; so, set state, drawing............. reuse transformed verts if possible.... set state, drawing........; somewhat important if you have a hefty vertex program",0
34702_irc_opengl,vampirefrog,nvtristrip seems simple to use.. perhaps I'll write a python binding :)); and use it from inside blender,0

35423_irc_opengl,Plagman,i.e. have a different path for ATI/NVIDIA and maybe different subpathes among those ones for different generations and that's it; that's how id did their tech3 engine,0
35423_irc_opengl,lexs,GLFW it was,0
35423_irc_opengl,Plagman,"That edge case only exists for radeon x800 and x1800 series, right? Before that NPOT wasn't advertised and now R600 fully supports it",0
35423_irc_opengl,feelgood_ICBM,Plagman yep,0
35423_irc_opengl,Plagman,What are you working on these days?,0
35423_irc_opengl,feelgood_ICBM,oh well Nvidia has piss poor support for NPOT volume textures on pre G8x so everyone has issues w/ this (to some extent) on older kit,0
35423_irc_opengl,LordHavoc,"Plagman: still maintaining darkplaces/nexuiz (although I've had more help in the last year than before), still tinkering with my new game",0
35423_irc_opengl,Plagman,Thankfully volume textures are somewhat less commonly used than wrapping combined with mipmapping,0
35423_irc_opengl,LordHavoc,Plagman: doing a bit of contract work for GarageGames on the next Torque engine,0
35423_irc_opengl,feelgood_ICBM,"honestly as I said if you want absolutely ""rock solid"" support for that extension then you need to keep w/ DX10 compliant hardware i.e. G8x, R6xx or better",0
35423_irc_opengl,Plagman,"LordHavoc: nice; New game, eh?",0
35423_irc_opengl,LordHavoc,yeah my texture loader doesn't even support generating npot on 3D textures (which I only use for light attenuation on dx8-class hardware); err generating pot from npot 3D textures; hence none of the uses in the engine are npot; npot 3D textures are the least of my concerns,0
35423_irc_opengl,Plagman,did you start writing new tech from scratch?,0
35423_irc_opengl,LordHavoc,Plagman: I did back in 2003,0
35423_irc_opengl,Plagman,or is it derived from DP on some extent?; I see,0
35423_irc_opengl,LordHavoc,Plagman: it's been *really* slow going,0
35423_irc_opengl,Plagman,"yeah, I know how slow this kind of stuff can get :p",0
35423_irc_opengl,LordHavoc,"Plagman: game design too ambitious; Plagman: honestly the engine has been a breeze to code, but the gamecode is a disasterous slug",0
35423_irc_opengl,Plagman,are you on your own?,0
35423_irc_opengl,LordHavoc,Plagman: yes unfortunately; Plagman: all the coder friends I recruited early on have been unable to work on the tech level involved,0
35423_irc_opengl,Plagman,that's what you get for being badass; poor you :P,0
35423_irc_opengl,LordHavoc,"Plagman: I mostly threw overboard the most gimmicky features one by one, like network proxies, ingame multiuser model editor (although this idea keeps returning)",0
35423_irc_opengl,Plagman,sounds ambitious,0
35423_irc_opengl,LordHavoc,Plagman: splitscreen died,0
35423_irc_opengl,Plagman,"Cube has a ingame multiuser level editor, right?",0
35423_irc_opengl,LordHavoc,"Plagman: Cube and Sauerbraten (aka Cube2) do, yes",0
35423_irc_opengl,Plagman,ahh... sauerbraten,0
35423_irc_opengl,LordHavoc,Plagman: however they don't use arbitrary modeled levels,0
35423_irc_opengl,Plagman,"yeah, I know",0
35423_irc_opengl,LordHavoc,"Plagman: which makes their data structures a little different to update; considering Verse support at the moment (synchronous editing in Blender and GIMP, of ingame assets)",0
35423_irc_opengl,Plagman,I've been watching looping demos of sauerbraten for several days in a row when one of my coworker was debugging a crash that it would randomly trigger in the driver; so we got familiar with the level editor in the meantime :D,0
35423_irc_opengl,LordHavoc,sounds like a mixture of pain and a little fun :),0
35423_irc_opengl,Plagman,"lots of waiting for something to happen involved; in the end I think it was a user error or something; oh well; anyway, I hope your project goes well; you probably don't know it but your work on quake is what got me started on the Duke3D source code",0
35423_irc_opengl,LordHavoc,cool,0
35423_irc_opengl,Plagman,now we're definitely not on par with DP feature-wise but things are progressing :p,0
35423_irc_opengl,LordHavoc,"Plagman: on the plus side, the per pixel lighting was a snap to implement in my game DarkWar, networking made me nearly have a nervous breakdown though; Plagman: (I knew how it should work, but I couldn't get my head around some concepts)",0
35423_irc_opengl,Plagman,"and the funny thing is that someone once called me ""the LordHavoc of Duke3D"" :P",0
35423_irc_opengl,LordHavoc,Plagman: and I ended up throwing out some of the key parts of the networking just to make progress,0
35423_irc_opengl,Plagman,"ah, yeah",0
35423_irc_opengl,LordHavoc,Plagman: (like proxied logins to a master server - eep),0
35423_irc_opengl,Plagman,I hate network programming; I really do,0
35423_irc_opengl,LordHavoc,"Plagman: you know what drove me nuts the most with the proxies?; Plagman: and actually, for that matter, with the unified client+server mode; Plagman: logging into yourself; Plagman: ... and having to contact an auth server to validate yourself; Plagman: on your own server; Plagman: except it's not a server, because it's a unified thing; Plagman: *head explodes*",0
35423_irc_opengl,Plagman,haha,0
35423_irc_opengl,LordHavoc,"Plagman: basically it was like saying ""well, I'm hosting this, so I get to break the rules, I don't need to be validated! - but wait, I need to tell others my info... which has to be validated! what?!?""; Plagman: so err yeah, it all came together when someone made a brilliant suggestion - run the full networking in loopback mode for the local player; Plagman: but ignore the entity updates; Plagman: no local copy of the server state, but the server still sends the state, it just gets ignored; Plagman: which solves the demo recording problem (just dump the network stream)",0
35423_irc_opengl,Plagman,I see; hehe,0
35423_irc_opengl,LordHavoc,Plagman: so it's like quake except without two arrays to keep in sync,0
35423_irc_opengl,Plagman,that's both elegant and dirty,0
35423_irc_opengl,LordHavoc,Plagman: quite clever,0
35423_irc_opengl,Plagman,I like the idea though,0
35423_irc_opengl,LordHavoc,Plagman: still a nuisance to test the entity networking (because it's possible to make something work locally but not over a network); Plagman: but at least I'm not having a nervous breakdown :),0
35423_irc_opengl,Plagman,"you're on your own on the coding side, what about the assets?",0
35423_irc_opengl,LordHavoc,Plagman: have one modeler who is active,0
35423_irc_opengl,Plagman,I see,0
35423_irc_opengl,LordHavoc,"Plagman: the other two I recruited (after knowing them for years) have been the laziest bums; Plagman: mostly because they have no imagination, they need concept art, and I've had absolutely zero success in finding a concept artist; Plagman: the modeler who joined and is active has a friend who is a concept artist though, but that concept artist makes everything look bizarre",0
35423_irc_opengl,Plagman,is indie distribution he goal of the project?; the*,0
35423_irc_opengl,LordHavoc,"Plagman: sort of; Plagman: free GPL game, with free online account registration, but accounts can be upgraded to premium accounts, and server admins can choose what to require (no account - good for players who like goofing off, not serious, free account - most players, higher probability of annoying punks and cheaters, premium account - really only the serious players will buy this, there are benefits to separating the community like this); Plagman: and sponsored tournament hosting services and stuff; Plagman: so it's basically give away the game but sell extra services",0
35423_irc_opengl,Plagman,yep,0
35423_irc_opengl,LordHavoc,"Plagman: I don't expect to make a fortune on it, but if it's enough to launch my game company it'll be fine",0
35423_irc_opengl,Plagman,this distribution model has proven its worth nowadays; i.e. F2P mmos,0
35423_irc_opengl,LordHavoc,Plagman: hard to stay indie otherwise,0
35423_irc_opengl,Plagman,yeah; I've never heard of it before though. Is it even announced somewhere?,0
35423_irc_opengl,LordHavoc,"to be honest I'm an artist more than a programmer; and I've always thought that art is a far better product to be selling than the code; selling level packs and such is straightforward; nope, not announced; partly because it's still not even playable; early hype can be a disaster",0
35423_irc_opengl,Plagman,yeah,0
35423_irc_opengl,LordHavoc,"so, slow but progressing",0
35423_irc_opengl,Plagman,can't wait to be hearing from it =),0
35423_irc_opengl,LordHavoc,so far the things that have worked great in the game design are:,0
35423_irc_opengl,Plagman,may you avoid development hell,0
35423_irc_opengl,LordHavoc,"in-head first person view - view bobbing and weapon anims and all that are not faked, they're literally based on the player model animations; works great, the immersion is great",0
35423_irc_opengl,Plagman,ala FEAR,0
35423_irc_opengl,LordHavoc,and of course death anims and pain anims and such are great; not much else has really worked out so far :); although the art pipeline has been nice with .obj support directly,0
35423_irc_opengl,Plagman,oh yeah? what about animation/attachments?; The ragdoll frenzy has passed its peak though; game programmers are reverting to regular death anims or hybrid approaches,0
35423_irc_opengl,LordHavoc,"Plagman: anim/attachments - I found that due to the first-person viewpoint there's an increased demand on proper weapon-specific animations; Plagman: so basically I decided that the weapon model has to go in the player model, and have a different player model and animations for each weapon/playerclass combination",0
35423_irc_opengl,Plagman,I take it that you don't have any kind of skeletal animation approach,0
35423_irc_opengl,LordHavoc,"Plagman: so a rifle is held properly, reloaded properly, etc",0
35423_irc_opengl,Plagman,"yeah, I know what you mean",0
35423_irc_opengl,LordHavoc,"Plagman: because reusing a rifle reload anim for a shotgun doesn't work, nor does firing anim, and idle anim is debatable",0
35423_irc_opengl,Plagman,IIRC quake only has a couple different stances but not one for each weapon,0
35423_irc_opengl,LordHavoc,"Plagman: and most other weapons (rifle anims on a pistol, or vice versa, etc) look stupid",0
35423_irc_opengl,Plagman,actually I may be confusing with Half-Life,0
35423_irc_opengl,LordHavoc,"quake had only one stance, and 3 firing anims, and a set of axe anims",0
35423_irc_opengl,Plagman,"but yeah, having a specific set of animation for each weapon sounds like the right thing to do if your animators can keep up :p",0
35423_irc_opengl,LordHavoc,"well, two stances, one for axe; Heretic II had the best animation I've seen; which is kind of amazing because it wasn't even skeletal; 2600 frames at 10fps for one character; it blended between different aiming up/down anim sets; (a technique that works well for skeletal too); and had special switch and stance anims for every weapon type",0
35423_irc_opengl,Plagman,"LordHavoc: heh, I'm sure it didn't use up much memory thanks to almighty MD2; hurray for byte encoded coordinates; 2600 frames per character is still outstanding; even by today standards I guess",0
35423_irc_opengl,LordHavoc,"Plagman: yeah; Plagman: although The Sims 2 (the game that drove Will Wright crazy enough to create Spore with totally procedural animation instead); Plagman: has 25000 ANIMATIONS for one skeleton; Plagman: can only imagine the frame count; yeah vertex morph anims are generally derived from skeletal; I've been told by animators that vertex morph is a *lot* easier to work with than skeletal though; because there's no rigging upfront (which can take days to a week in some cases); perfectly engineering a skeleton is harder than just selecting mesh to move, apparently (I don't have personal experience with character animation); err mesh areas to move; certainly is more technical; HL2 has both at once; usually the vertex morph anims (which are played exactly in sync, frame for frame) are used for facial animation; in a way I have to look back at Quake3's approach with fondness, it has a serious issue inherent in it (separate objects attached to eachother, resulting in noticably incorrect waist geometry when significantly tilted), but the concept itself may be pretty optimal, if it were vertex morph + skeletal instead (assign sections of the mesh to lower/upper/head/weapon/etc)",0
35602_irc_opengl,tmccrary,"Does anyone have any tips on getting some reasonable level of performance out of intel graphics?; My sky box is KILLING the framerate; without it, everything runs pretty good; So it looks like fill rate on intel cards is garbage",1
35602_irc_opengl,feelgood_ICBM,the best advice I can give you is to simply stay far away from anything at all fill-rate intensive; on the GMA et al series; due to the shared VRAM architecture; of course that advice is somewhat moot since you also don't have the fragment resources to generate texture(s) procedurally :P,2

42029_irc_opengl,KU0N,yea; other ships will be too far,0
42029_irc_opengl,MatthiasM,then use a 16bit depth shadow map with znear/zfar set to just the bounding box of your space ship,2
42029_irc_opengl,KU0N,"maybe stations, but for this, I can use very rough algo (basically, you are behind it or not)",0

42460_irc_opengl,michele_m,hi; what's the best way to manage 2 different subregions in a window with different contexes?; for example in a panel rendering some things while in another displaying a texture?,1
42460_irc_opengl,MatthiasM,michele_m: use one context and glViewport + glScissors,2
42460_irc_opengl,michele_m,"what if I have 2 different panels, each with it's different stuff?",0
42460_irc_opengl,MatthiasM,panels ?,0
42460_irc_opengl,michele_m,uhmm yes in windows forms you can have panels which are used generally to organize stuff; anyway each panel has its own handle,0
42460_irc_opengl,MatthiasM,so you have 2 heavy weight containers each with it's own gl context ?,0
42460_irc_opengl,michele_m,yes,0
42460_irc_opengl,MatthiasM,so what is the problem ?,0
42460_irc_opengl,michele_m,"I have created a window form with 2 different ""containers"" (panels); and I'd like to render in both of them; I made a single loop with 2 different rendering contexes, one for each container; at each loop I switch context and do the rendering, but that's very poor, from a performance point of view",0
42460_irc_opengl,predaeus,"michele_m, how did you split the contexts? as far as I know OpenGL contexts are thread bound",0
42460_irc_opengl,michele_m,just call twice createContext :) of course with different window handles..,2
42460_irc_opengl,predaeus,"as far as I know all OpenGL calls issued in the same thread will go to the same context, but I don't know for sure. You'd have to multithread to get a separate context.",0
42460_irc_opengl,michele_m,"look, I'm oversimplifying the problem since I've made a c++ dll which creates a context and does the rendering; so instantiating twice that class gives me 2 different contexes; it works, it's just slow; no, you can have only ONE context active at any time in the same thread; so if you want to use 2 different contexes just switch between them; but a context switch it's painfully slow",0
42460_irc_opengl,MatthiasM,use 2 threads :D,0
42460_irc_opengl,michele_m,I'll give it a try; thanks,0
42460_irc_opengl,predaeus,"michele_m, that might be even slower, <a href=""http://www.equalizergraphics.com/documentation/parallelOpenGLFAQ.html#one"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.equalizergraphics.com/documentation/parallelOpenGLFAQ.html#one</a> this indicates that multiple threads with separate contexts on the same card will switch context randomly which makes it even slower.",0
42460_irc_opengl,michele_m,that's not good :x,0
42460_irc_opengl,predaeus,"they recommend to keep the rendering serial, so one thread renders it's stuff then the other. not interleaved.",0
42460_irc_opengl,michele_m,but by doing this I must do a context switch,0
42460_irc_opengl,predaeus,"michele_m, maybe the impact is not as big if it the context switch is implicitly done by the thread context switch. If you additionally keep the commands serial it might work. Not sure though.; maybe there is an additional penalty when switching a context inside a thread.",0
42460_irc_opengl,michele_m,serializing things forces me to do this: application.doevents() -&gt; engine1.getcontext() -&gt; engine1.render() -&gt; engine2.getcontext() -> engine2.render(); in a loop; since the second rendering it's not that important I could just do it once in a while (every 100 frames for example); but I have to do some testing,0
42460_irc_opengl,predaeus,... this might be what MatthiasM indicated. There can't be such a big hit if two processes using opengl side by side render. so maybe that's just when switching context inside the thread.,0
42460_irc_opengl,michele_m,one is for displaying the whole scene; the second displays only the texture associated to one object in the scene (the active one),0
42460_irc_opengl,MatthiasM,michele_m: why not make one huge GL display and split it up using glViewport and glScissors ?,0
42460_irc_opengl,tmccrary,You'd probably be better off just using glViewport as MatthiasM suggested,0
42460_irc_opengl,MatthiasM,then you also don't need to upload textures twice; (assuming you don't share them now),0
42460_irc_opengl,tmccrary,"You'd just define the first viewport, setup the matrices and render. Then do the same thing for the second viewport; and you wouldn't have to deal with threading fun-ness :)",0
42460_irc_opengl,michele_m,"<a href=""http://img511.imageshack.us/img511/3230/immagine1yi2.png"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://img511.imageshack.us/img511/3230/immagine1yi2.png</a>; that's my application",0
42460_irc_opengl,tmccrary,yep looks like a perfect canidate,0
42460_irc_opengl,predaeus,there is a lot of applications that must have 2 contexts for exactly the same purpose or for showing models in an extra view. So the impact can't be so big when done correctly.,0
42460_irc_opengl,michele_m,"you have a point :); have to study glScissors then, never used before",0
42460_irc_opengl,predaeus,"michele_m, I still think it can be done, I don't know for sure, but I guess the Crysis editor also shows models in it's GUI, and d3d and GL should'nt be too different in that regard.; michele_m, and that editor runs the game engine in realtime.",0
42460_irc_opengl,michele_m,that's what I was thinking when doing things in my way; I should ask a friend of mine that works at the National Council of Research :P; thanks guys; see ya,0
42460_irc_opengl,abionnnn,"quicksilver: yer that's the beauty of that origin :P; quicksilver: I see, it looks rather awful on this shitty 6-bit monitor. I really wish the LCD manufacturers went for quality instead of response time",0
42460_irc_opengl,quicksilver,"abionnnn: it looked a little banded to me, I wondered if you had smooth shading on or not.; abionnnn: but, the eye is very good at picking out perfect circles :); abionnnn: if the light wasn't quite head on you'd probably find the banding less obvious.",0
42460_irc_opengl,abionnnn,yes indeed :P it did look banded!; that's the term I was looking for thanks,0
42460_irc_opengl,quicksilver,"decent 6-bit monitors are indistinguishable from 8-bit monitors to all but the most expert eye.; (they time-wise-dither the other bits, it works fine)",0

1407_irc_angularjs,crocket,"caitp, plain javascript can be great except 3rd party libraries come with a lot of globals.",0
1407_irc_angularjs,iksik,it's really subjective caitp ;),0
1407_irc_angularjs,crocket,There should be a better approach I think.,0
1407_irc_angularjs,caitp,globals are not really a problem; not in and of themselves,0
1407_irc_angularjs,Foxandxss,I tend to agree with caitp here; all those stuff are crap :P,0
1407_irc_angularjs,caitp,"angular has a point about globals making testing difficult, because changes bleed through between different specs; so that's a problem; but it can be circumvented; IE with angular's injector",0
1407_irc_angularjs,crocket,hmm,0
1407_irc_angularjs,caitp,"which also simplifies mocking, and everything else nice",0
1407_irc_angularjs,crocket,"caitp, 3rd party librareis have their own globals that you can't control.",0
1407_irc_angularjs,caitp,you don't use every 3rd party library in your web app; you use the ones you use; you have control over those,0

1407_irc_angularjs,caitp,"no, and why should they care to; it's not a concern; soon we'll have native es6 modules and everyone will get their own global context and you won't have to ""worry"" about it anymore (although I think the worry is misplaced); you should understand your app; if you don't understand your app, there's a deeper problem than module systems",0
1407_irc_angularjs,crocket,"caitp, I haven't bought the notion that browser globals are not a problem yet.",0
1407_irc_angularjs,caitp,are Arrays a problem?; Strings? Maps? Sets?; HTMLElements?; typed arrays?; these are all globals; it doesn't matter; it makes literally no difference,0
1407_irc_angularjs,crocket,They are agreed on from the beginning.,0
1407_irc_angularjs,caitp,so are the libraries you import,0
1407_irc_angularjs,crocket,The libraries do not advertise what globals they use.,0
1407_irc_angularjs,caitp,"yes, they do",0
1407_irc_angularjs,crocket,"caitp, Often, you have to inspect the code to know.",0
1407_irc_angularjs,caitp,you really don't; libraries are not setting piles of variables on the global context; they're setting a handful at most; lodash or underscore set one global property; jquery sets 2; requirejs sets two; etc,0
1407_irc_angularjs,crocket,"caitp, If you use a pile of libraries, it's a different matter.",0
1407_irc_angularjs,caitp,it's really not a different matter; you know what libraries you're using; you know what they export; you know if they conflict or not,0
1407_irc_angularjs,crocket,"caitp, Libraries come with dependencies.",0
1407_irc_angularjs,alathon,"caitp: I agree that you should understand as much library code as possible. I also agree that the problem is often over-advertised, and stems from other languages where it can have more severe consequences.",0
1407_irc_angularjs,crocket,Dependency tree depth can be 3-5.,0
1407_irc_angularjs,caitp,"you know about the dependencies too; lol, this is not node.js",0
1407_irc_angularjs,alathon,caitp: But there is value in being inherently safe. In not needing to worry. Especially for larger projects.,0
1407_irc_angularjs,caitp,"you are loading the dependencies yourself; you always need to know this stuff, alathon",0
1407_irc_angularjs,crocket,"caitp, With browserify, it's easy to import npm modules just by specifying them in pacakge.json. The dependencies are just pulled automatically.",0
1407_irc_angularjs,caitp,"there is no situation in engineering, ever, where you can ignore important data",0
1407_irc_angularjs,alathon,"caitp: Thats just not true, though.",0
1407_irc_angularjs,caitp,"it is true; if you're ignoring important data, you're doing a bad job",0
1407_irc_angularjs,crocket,The beauty of it is that you don't have to inspect the code to be really sure that library authors export globals secretly.,0
1407_irc_angularjs,caitp,"if you're not acquiring data in the first place, you're doing a bad job",0
1407_irc_angularjs,crocket,The beauty of it is that you don't have to inspect the code to be really sure that library authors don't export globals secretly.,0
1407_irc_angularjs,caitp,exporting globals is not a problem,0
1407_irc_angularjs,crocket,Exporting unadvertised globals is a problem.,0
1407_irc_angularjs,alathon,"caitp: Consider a different example, since we're talking generally here. I know how to use java.util.concurrent, but have I looked through all of the code there, to make sure its not doing something bad? Absolutely not.",0
1407_irc_angularjs,caitp,that doesn't really happen; can you name an example of any popular library that does that?,0
1407_irc_angularjs,crocket,"caitp, That happens sometimes.",0
1407_irc_angularjs,caitp,name an example,0
1407_irc_angularjs,crocket,"caitp, What if you want to use two libraries that export globals in the same name?",0
1407_irc_angularjs,caitp,"then you have conflicting libraries, you should be aware of it",0
1407_irc_angularjs,alathon,"Oh what a perfect world it would be, if I had time to look through all code of every library I ever used :)",0
1407_irc_angularjs,caitp,we're talking about web apps,0
1407_irc_angularjs,alathon,"Unfortunately, I don't, so I have to assume things, and strict enforcement of certain things that can go bad, help me do that.",0
1407_irc_angularjs,caitp,1) they aren't that big,0
1407_irc_angularjs,crocket,"caitp, I don't like having to know internals of every library and dependency I get to use.",0
1407_irc_angularjs,caitp,"2) you don't need zillions of libraries; 3) the libraries you do use, should be ones that you understand",0
1407_irc_angularjs,alathon,"caitp: I agree, in practice the problem is almost non-existant. And I also agree that employing a sketchy solution to solve something you may never run into, violates a whole host of 'Dont dos'.",0
1407_irc_angularjs,caitp,"you can be expected to grok the dependency tree; it's not that hard, it's worth doing, and it makes you rely less on badness like browserify; with dynamic languages, I don't totally trust static analysis that much; what about it; you could use input[type=number]; write a custom directive to add a parser to it?",0

5290_irc_angularjs,robdubya_,anth0ny you're confusing your state urls with your API urls,0
5290_irc_angularjs,thebigredgeek,use that; you can encode JS objects; into your state as variables; its all URI safe; so rather than a single value you can instead store many; let me know if that works,0
5290_irc_angularjs,robdubya_,you realllly dont need 3rd party lib to do this; regardless of how spectacular it might be,0

5290_irc_angularjs,anth0ny,"okay, so I have this list of events; whats going on in a given city",0
5290_irc_angularjs,robdubya_,ok; so you've got a controller and a ng-repeat,0

5290_irc_angularjs,robdubya_,different templates?,0
5290_irc_angularjs,anth0ny,a better example than drilling down is actually futher investigating the event; yeah; different template,0
5290_irc_angularjs,robdubya_,ok. so list -> detail,0
5290_irc_angularjs,anth0ny,"basically; so, anyways, the list is by defautl for today; if you hit the api at /api/events you get todays events; but, if you hit /api/events?date=2014-04-01, you get that dates events",0
5290_irc_angularjs,robdubya_,right,0
5290_irc_angularjs,anth0ny,"so, im trying to bring that out to the list",0
5290_irc_angularjs,robdubya_,correct me if i'm wrong - but if you're on todays events; and you want to look at yesterdays,0
5290_irc_angularjs,anth0ny,the only time youre really putting a date on is at the /events view,0
5290_irc_angularjs,robdubya_,"same view, different data",0
5290_irc_angularjs,anth0ny,correct; theres a little calendar that you click and it should load that days data; same view,0
5290_irc_angularjs,robdubya_,okay.; so that doesn't require anything to do with urls; but continue,0
5290_irc_angularjs,anth0ny,"im trying to wire the calendar up to, when clicked, append the date to the URL, which will then reload the view, that view looks at the $location and combines that with the $state.params and passes all of that as args to the API service",0
5290_irc_angularjs,robdubya_,why do all that; just send another ajax request,0
5290_irc_angularjs,anth0ny,"the reason taht Im going through the URL is because I want that state to be reproducable; if thats the right verbage; like, I can send you a link for tomorrows events and it will show tomorrows events; to me, that means that it would need to be encoded in the URL",0
5290_irc_angularjs,robdubya_,thats' fine - but the base route is still /events,0

5968_irc_angularjs,mbroadst,"is there an easy way to modify $resource's behavior to capture extra header data? the rest api I'm working with returns a content-range header for pagination, so it'd be nice to grab that rather than making a separate request for total counts etc",1

6307_irc_angularjs,nicw,What's best way to integrate Angular with Django?,1
6307_irc_angularjs,wafflejock_,nicw: it's best to have a RESTful service layer,2
6307_irc_angularjs,nicw,"yeah, we're using djangoRESTframework",0
6307_irc_angularjs,wafflejock_,nicw: then you can use $resource in Angular to communicate with it; nicw: generally you do this from a service or factory; nicw: inject it into your controllers,0
6307_irc_angularjs,nicw,Any tips in in terms of project setup?,0
6307_irc_angularjs,wafflejock_,nicw: in terms of folder structure or git setup err...?,0
6307_irc_angularjs,nicw,wafflejock: Yeah so there's a couple options right. Ideally we'd want something like Django is just all the backend and we have a SPA for everything.,0
6307_irc_angularjs,wafflejock_,nicw: yeah I think that sounds good,0

6307_irc_angularjs,wafflejock_,jeffw198: very abstract question what are you looking to achieve,0
6307_irc_angularjs,jeffw198,probably true.,0
6307_irc_angularjs,wafflejock_,jeffw198: also services and facotries and values and constants are just various ways of defining a provider,0
6307_irc_angularjs,jeffw198,i'm aware of that; just looking for a way that i don't have to write all of the $http or $resource code for every service call,0
6307_irc_angularjs,wafflejock_,"well.... what would you want to get out of an abstraction above $resource?; I mean it's doable and I'm sure there are reasons but gotta determine what you're going to make easier and how; jeffw198: I mean how I do it is I write a service for each data ""type"" that I get from the service layer and each has a resource defined in it most of the code I can use find and replace to update for a new service; I suppose this could probably be abstracted but so far it's not a big problem",0
6307_irc_angularjs,jeffw198,ok. i was thinking something along the lines of backbone where i can specify a route and it will handle doing put/post/get/delete for me; i don't mind if i have to write it; just looking for guidance on whether it even makes sense,0
6307_irc_angularjs,wafflejock_,"jeffw198: that's what $resource does; jeffw198: you say $resource(""books"")",0
6307_irc_angularjs,jeffw198,hmm i will research $resource more then. apparently i misunderstood it from briefly looking at the docs,0
6307_irc_angularjs,wafflejock_,"er var bookResource = $resource(""books""); then bookResource.query(); and that does a get; it takes some tinkering with but notice the $promise part I wasn't aware of and is helpful",0
6307_irc_angularjs,jeffw198,"hmm, apparently i fail at reading the docs. $resource does look it should accomplish most of what i want to do",0
6307_irc_angularjs,wafflejock_,cool yeah I was resistant at first being comfy with $http but I'm liking the reduction in code with $resource; it's worth the minor headaches,0
6307_irc_angularjs,jeffw198,i've used $http so far and it felt too verbose,0
6307_irc_angularjs,wafflejock_,yeah start getting broken record syndrome; I still feel it a little bit so maybe an abstraction above $resource is in order but just gotta think that through very carefully,0

6410_irc_angularjs,c0bra,carpediembaby: you can't change the dom of whatever you want to be in a controller?,0
6410_irc_angularjs,carpediembaby,c0bra: i would rather not. It is a standard layout approach. The layout is outside and the content of the page is rendered inside this layout and each page defines its own controller,0
6410_irc_angularjs,c0bra,carpediembaby: you can check out angular.bootstrap,0

6445_irc_angularjs,mu_phy,I'm trying to unit test a controller in Angular that uses the $location service to parse query params. I read that $location.search won't yield any results unless $locationProvider.html5mode(true) is set. I'm not sure where the correct place to set this would be within my jasmine tests. Outside of a test I set it in the config block for my app module. Should I add a .config method to my angular.mocks.module('foo') statement and inject the $locationProvide; or is there a better way to go about this that I'm not aware of?,1
6445_irc_angularjs,lsiv568,mu_phy: Why not mock the $location service you inject into the controller,2
6445_irc_angularjs,mu_phy,I hadn't thought of that lsiv568,0
6445_irc_angularjs,lsiv568,you can implement your own search function to do whatever you want,0
6626_irc_angularjs,jeffw198,anyone used the ng-boilerplate?; personally i'm not a fan of all the extra shit it installs when you run the setup; i like to know what all of the dependencies i'm adding to my project are,1
6626_irc_angularjs,wafflejock_,"yeah I like to aim somewhere in between too, I don't want to do all the manual labor but I don't want things around I don't know about",2
6626_irc_angularjs,jeffw198,yep; bower goes a long way toward simplifying project setup that's for sure,0
6626_irc_angularjs,wafflejock_,yeah speeds things up and makes updating fairly easy,0
6626_irc_angularjs,jeffw198,"i haven't had a chance to play w/ grunt/yeoman yet, although that's my plan for monday; seems pretty straightforward though",0
6626_irc_angularjs,oniijin,a well set up grunt is soooooo handy; the one from boilerplate is actually pretty nice,0
6626_irc_angularjs,jeffw198,"i guess i come from the .NET world, so i'm just used to using nuget for most thing",0
6626_irc_angularjs,oniijin,does all the js/css/mini,0
6626_irc_angularjs,wafflejock_,yeah yeoman is really just to get the stuff configured but grunt is pretty sweet with livereload and linting/minifying/concating etc. etc.,0
6626_irc_angularjs,oniijin,lol,0
6626_irc_angularjs,jeffw198,livereload is cool; that is definitely worthwhile,0
6626_irc_angularjs,wafflejock_,yeah; specially when testing across devices,0

6626_irc_angularjs,oniijin,o maybe u know then wafflejock_ ... sometimes my livereload gets goofed bc build gets rebuilt; so i have to stop my server (just usin simplehttp) and restart,0
6626_irc_angularjs,wafflejock_,hmm no havne't seen that problem; you mean CI is botching it?,0
6626_irc_angularjs,oniijin,not really sure y the build folder sometimes get deleted and remade; i assume something in grunttask is doin it; but I havent been able to figure out what. o well,0
6626_irc_angularjs,wafflejock_,yeah dunno I've let it run for quite a while before and not run into that; will let you know if it crops up,0

6871_irc_angularjs,blaskovicz,d10n why cant you table in a table?,0
6871_irc_angularjs,jharbaugh,d10n: you could nest a table inside a &lt;tr> angular repeater; so instead of a div it's a tr with a table inside of it.,0
6871_irc_angularjs,blaskovicz,you could wrap your trs with a span too; &lt;table&gt;&lt;span ng-repeat='item in items'&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr ng-repeat='subitem in item.subitems'&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/table>,0

6908_irc_angularjs,dweaver06,has anyone here ever implemented embedded pdfs in an angular app; hey what is the best way to $observe an attribute ONLY one time. My understanding is that angular will interpolate the value on each digest by default; i only want it to interpolate it once (the first time it gets it).,1

6908_irc_angularjs,dweaver06,and how would you do that; isnt that still going to $watch the property; @ just means its a one way binding no?,0
6908_irc_angularjs,Foxandxss,yes; you just want to interpolate an attribute once; and forget about binding,0

9897_irc_angularjs,BahamutWC,"ah, this is what FesterCluck is talking about: <a href=""http://eisenbergeffect.bluespire.com/angular-and-durandal-converge/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://eisenbergeffect.bluespire.com/angular-and-durandal-converge/</a> - very interesting",0
9897_irc_angularjs,FesterCluck,Your link/compile function is typically used for the INITIAL RENDER of the directive.,0
9897_irc_angularjs,renlord,mmhmm,0
9897_irc_angularjs,FesterCluck,Your directive should have a controller,0
9897_irc_angularjs,renlord,if the socket listener sits in the linking function; what's the controller for?,0
9897_irc_angularjs,FesterCluck,No; Your socket should be in a factory service; Which is injected into the controller.,0
9897_irc_angularjs,renlord,I have a wrapper around sockets in factory,0
9897_irc_angularjs,FesterCluck,"renlord: Good; So, your controller has the service injected.; The controller updates values on scope.; Which is your template's scope",0
9897_irc_angularjs,renlord,and I use scope in linking to do the DOM Manipulations?,0
9897_irc_angularjs,FesterCluck,"renlord: Basically, you shouldn't typically be dumping direct DOM objects in like that",0
9897_irc_angularjs,renlord,i'm manipulating a d3 tree node,0
9897_irc_angularjs,FesterCluck,Loading leaves?,0
9897_irc_angularjs,renlord,"I don't know how to avoid manipulating the DOM directly; yeap and also changing leaf contents; like colour, value etc",0
9897_irc_angularjs,FesterCluck,"renlord: You avoid manipulating the DOM tree directly by binding attribute values to values in the controller scope.; attributes == directives; So, by changing properties you can load new directives.; Occasionally this will lead to you needing to use the $compile function directly",0
9897_irc_angularjs,renlord,is there an example?; that's similar to this?,0
9897_irc_angularjs,FesterCluck,"renlord: Can you be more specific about what you are doing on the d3 tree, I could probably explain better then",0
9897_irc_angularjs,renlord,"yes.; I am actually trying to render a sports bracket on a d3 tree. each tree node represents a match; I want to be able to select each match and a Modal pops up, allowing me to edit, match information and change the ""match node"" colour; reflecting its current state; I have successfully got each Modal to pop up now; but it is done using .on(click), not even the angular way",0
9897_irc_angularjs,FesterCluck,"Alright, do you have d3 abstracted out into a service?",0
9897_irc_angularjs,renlord,nope; I didnt know I needed to do that; so is this similar to a wrapper around sockets?,0

9897_irc_angularjs,renlord,what's the catch?; yeah,0
9897_irc_angularjs,FesterCluck,"However, if you have the time to learn the SVG yourself, or if you have access to the SVG templates, Angular will bind on SVG just as it will HTML",0
9897_irc_angularjs,renlord,FesterCluck: so there's no easy way to have Angular bind on tree nodes easily?,0
9897_irc_angularjs,FesterCluck,renlord: Sure there is; Check out that article I posted you,0
9897_irc_angularjs,renlord,okay.; thank you FesterCluck,0
9897_irc_angularjs,FesterCluck,"Their basic answer is to use watch; renlord: It could be done better, but their way is effective",0
9897_irc_angularjs,renlord,FesterCluck: Is it possible to append directives as leaves instead; to maximise the utility of data binding,0
9897_irc_angularjs,FesterCluck,^; Yes]; That's what you are looking for,0
9897_irc_angularjs,renlord,I read thru the article you've sent me and noticed they focus on the entire SVG; instead of each individual bar,0
9897_irc_angularjs,FesterCluck,"renlord: So, does this bracket allow for adding/removing nodes after the initial render?",0
9897_irc_angularjs,renlord,yes; ok. so lets say I'm gonna do append directives as leaves instead. I'll most likely have a Tree Directive and Leaf Directives yes?,0
9897_irc_angularjs,FesterCluck,Yes.,0
9897_irc_angularjs,renlord,"and within the Tree Directive itself, while appending the leaf directives, how do I make sure it compiles; because I tried a hack like .attr('ng-click', 'hi()'), that obviously did not work, because angular didnt recognise there was a directive in there",0
9897_irc_angularjs,FesterCluck,renlord: Use an ng-repeat in the leaves' parent node; To create the leaves,0
9897_irc_angularjs,renlord,"FesterCluck: why use ng-repeat though, d3 has a very nice way to generate the tree structure just by doing tree.nodes(bracket)",0
9897_irc_angularjs,FesterCluck,"renlord: ng-repeat would get you the hook to the digest cycle, and therefore the 2-way binding to the leaves",0
9897_irc_angularjs,renlord,so that's essentially dumping d3 yea?,0
9897_irc_angularjs,FesterCluck,"renlord: Actually, here's the medium you are looking for:; <a href=""http://odiseo.net/angularjs/proper-use-of-d3-js-with-angular-directives"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://odiseo.net/angularjs/proper-use-of-d3-js-with-angular-directives</a>",0

9897_irc_angularjs,FesterCluck,"renlord: You need to get data initially for the entire tree, yes... but everything is atomic after that; renlord: And don't forget about the ng-if directive; Think of it this way:",0

9897_irc_angularjs,FesterCluck,"renlord: Exactly, make and ng-click run a function that changes the value that ng-if is watching; renlord: In that way you can cause nodes to be rendered on the fly; renlord: As far as drag/drop, if d3 supports it, I don't see why it wouldn't just work; renlord: As long as d3 actually moves the nodes around, and never tries to recreate or duplicate them]",0

10066_irc_angularjs,yoshokatana,"lrocksmashtime: &lt;li ng-repeat=x in exes ng-click=dosomething()> ???; doSomething could look at some scope variable or something, I guess",2
10066_irc_angularjs,lrocksmashtime,yoshokatana: ok now say that directive is used in a single view multiple times and each time a different callback needs to be triggered,0
10066_irc_angularjs,yoshokatana,"or the $index, or the phase of the moon, etc",0
10066_irc_angularjs,lrocksmashtime,"i was thinking that it would require an additional directive attr like &lt;my-directive on-click=""angular expression"">",0
10066_irc_angularjs,yoshokatana,lrocksmashtime: you dont need any custom directives for that; just switch the thing depending on whatever; e.g.; &lt;li ng-repeat=foo in bars ng-click=doSomething(foo.theThingToDo)>; where theThingToDo changes depending on all the different things you can do,0
10066_irc_angularjs,lrocksmashtime,"wouldn't it just be ng-click=""foo.theThingToDo""",0
10066_irc_angularjs,oniijin,then u would need to delcare a whole bunch of things to do,0

10122_irc_angularjs,robdubya,"welcome to angular, i love you; nick_w service",2
10122_irc_angularjs,nick_w,Is it a good idea to have an array of data in the service?,0
10122_irc_angularjs,robdubya,"its not just a good idea, its the ultimate idea; nirvana, even",0
10122_irc_angularjs,nick_w,So right now I have a service with a get that gets the data.,0

10122_irc_angularjs,nickeddy,lol; probably not a good thing but; i'm lazy,0
10122_irc_angularjs,davemo,"heh, i like this robdubya guy :)",0
10122_irc_angularjs,nick_w,So you could do something like BookFactory.data to get all the new bookszzz; every post we just add that new item (if successful) to BookFactory.data ?,0
10122_irc_angularjs,robdubya,nick_w yeah - it really depends on how volatile your data is,0
10122_irc_angularjs,nick_w,it's not,0
10122_irc_angularjs,robdubya,"but i normally have a layer in between the $http/$resource stuff, and my controllers; so you keep a kind of cache inside the factory",0
10122_irc_angularjs,nick_w,Is there some way to tell the books controller that we added a book so it should get the data from the api again?,0
10122_irc_angularjs,robdubya,meaning you're always using the same *instance* of the object,0
10122_irc_angularjs,nickeddy,robdubya: what's that called? not singleton but; i mean i guess it is,0

10358_irc_angularjs,nickeddy,"robdubya: then again, i'm usually the one asking questions and you answering them haha",0
10358_irc_angularjs,jaawerth,it also depends on how much caching and data processing you plan on doing locally,0

12271_irc_angularjs,Hounddog,Stephen: i am not changing anything,0
12271_irc_angularjs,Stephen,"Hounddog: Because grabbing the HTML should provide you a promise, so you are good there. In a typical directive you can modify the template you're about to bind in the compile method, so you're good there. What are you needing to modify that needs to be that late?",0

14090_irc_angularjs,cthrax,"alho, the table and the error would be directives that take a property of the scope as an attribute; when that property changes the data in each directive does; bound together by one controller",0

15099_irc_angularjs,marisa_,hello everyone wonder if you can help me with something - i have been a developer for about 3 years(2.5 of those years spent in a rubbish company with not a lot of challenge) and recently started playing with JS and html5 and css3 and i really enjoy the front end stuff however i feel like i am rubbish - i never feel good enough; what can i do to be better? what projects do I work on in my own time? i dont want to just code i want to write stuff wherei learn a lot please give me advice,1
15099_irc_angularjs,wdom,marisa_: I have the same situation. I just picked up a hobby project with MEAN stack,2
15099_irc_angularjs,quan___,marisa_: youre strictly front-end ?,0
15099_irc_angularjs,wdom,marisa_: Already learned tons of good stuff,0
15099_irc_angularjs,ncbw,marisa_: get a more challening job? :),0
15099_irc_angularjs,marisa_,quan__ i do backend as well but i enjoy front end more; currently i do a bit of c# backend but eventually i want just front end i love it; and WANT to get better at it,0
15099_irc_angularjs,wdom,marisa_: I'd say learn MEAN stack. you'll get some look at backend too,0
15099_irc_angularjs,marisa_,wdom any good links/books?,0
15099_irc_angularjs,wdom,mean.io; great boilerplate to start,0
15099_irc_angularjs,marisa_,thank you,0
15099_irc_angularjs,wdom,Also lots of good tutorials on MEAN,0
15099_irc_angularjs,quan___,id think of a simple app and do a end-to-end integration using the technologies youre interested in,0

15099_irc_angularjs,marisa_,quan__ understand that was going to be my next question - what do i build; i am curently reading through ngBook but find it that something is missing; i need that spark if that makes sense and ngBook isnt giving me it,0
15099_irc_angularjs,wdom,marisa_: I'm doing fantasy football for my friends for world cup.. Just something usefull to do,0
15099_irc_angularjs,quan___,"well it should be something that is not overly complicated where you can focus on architecting a good solution rather than solving complicated app issues; so, rss reader maybe, or something like wdom just said or maybe a simple app maybe you could find useful at your job; like a time keeper app",0
15099_irc_angularjs,marisa_,worth poiting out i am an average developer only being 22 but i want to get better - i do know how to program just need that little bit extra if that makes sense - i want to focus on front end as a niche and become good at it,0
15099_irc_angularjs,wdom,"marisa_: Its good to pick up mean.io boilerplate, and think of some kind of fun CRUD app for example",0
15099_irc_angularjs,marisa_,wdom understand - thats my problem i am usualyl stuck for ideas on what to build,0
15099_irc_angularjs,wdom,marisa_: then play with bootstrap and angular-ui for beautiful front end,0

15188_irc_angularjs,dKc,hi i've got a question about angular apps. in tutorial there is a way to get data (infos about phones) from .json files and as we know that kind of files can be easily read from firebug for example. Is that really recommended way to access data from Angular-style apps?,1
15188_irc_angularjs,BahamutWC|Work,dKc: it's only a demo,2
15188_irc_angularjs,wafflejock,dKc: yeah it's just mocking an endpoint that returns JSON,2
15188_irc_angularjs,dKc,"BahamutWC, so recommended way is to use SQL and php?",0
15188_irc_angularjs,wafflejock,"dKc: the recommended way is to make a RESTful service that ""speaks"" JSON",0
15188_irc_angularjs,dKc,"so json files are not recommended in angular; wafflejock, ok, then i don't get it why Angular is MVC-style. I thought Model is database and we don't have a database here",0
15188_irc_angularjs,wafflejock,dKc: you can do this with PHP/MySQL check out Slim framework it makes setting up server side routes that adhere to REST specs; dKc: the model in angular is the javascript objects you make as the model; dKc: they are typically populated from a datasource,0
15188_irc_angularjs,dKc,so model in angular != model in php ?,0
15188_irc_angularjs,wafflejock,dKc: yeah not necessarily the same thing exactly but usually you end up with a close to 1:1,0
15188_irc_angularjs,dKc,"wafflejock, ok thanks :)",0
15188_irc_angularjs,wafflejock,"dKc: check out slim php framework here's my route config on the server side <a href=""http://pastebin.com/jPCe9pug"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://pastebin.com/jPCe9pug</a>; dKc: with this setup I create a module in angular for each of the data types I'm interacting with on the database layer like people.js projects.js etc. and they each use a $resource to communicate with the PHP layer with this kind of setup you write far less boilerplate for CRUD",0
15188_irc_angularjs,dKc,"wafflejock, is Slim works well with Angular?",0
15188_irc_angularjs,wafflejock,"you can even abstract the client side API stuff further; dKc: yeah well RESTful endpoints work well with $resource is the main thing; dKc: Slim just makes it easy to setup RESTful endpoints in PHP; dKc: you can do this with Zend or laravel or lots of other PHP framworks but Slim is slim; generally gets better performance and just has the features I need plus a few extras but not too much and I really only use a small piece of it right now; dKc: that said lots of people are using NodeJS (MEAN stack or otherwise), Ruby, Python, whatever you can think of on the server side",0
15188_irc_angularjs,dKc,"wafflejock, i don't get it that REST thing. Is that always passes data in .json format ?",0
15188_irc_angularjs,wafflejock,"dKc: REST has to do with the endpoints and using the correct HTTP verbs to express what needs to be done; dKc: and making things sessionless there are more stringent rules if you stick to strict REST but the first part I mentioned is key to making it work with $resource; dKc: so say you are storing books; for CRUD (create read update delete) of books you would do <a href=""http://mysite/books"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://mysite/books</a> as a GET request method to get a list of all books, <a href=""http://mysite/books"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://mysite/books</a> POST to add a new book with the book data in the body as JSON, <a href=""http://mysite/books/1"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://mysite/books/1</a> GET to get a single book <a href=""http://mysite/books/1"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://mysite/books/1</a> DELETE to delete a single book <a href=""http://mysite/books/1"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://mysite/books/1</a> PUT/POST for updates to book 1; dKc: so basically once you know the object type your dealing with you also know all the ways to interact with it by just knowing the base URL",0
15188_irc_angularjs,nickeddy,wafflejock: i think you may be better off just linking to an article :P,0
15188_irc_angularjs,wafflejock,that's true :P,0
15188_irc_angularjs,dKc,"well i just to about read REST definition on wikipedia :) but wafflejock's words are handful, too",0
15188_irc_angularjs,wafflejock,"dKc: this looks pretty good <a href=""http://www.androidhive.info/2014/01/how-to-create-rest-api-for-android-app-using-php-slim-and-mysql-day-23/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.androidhive.info/2014/01/how-to-create-rest-api-for-android-app-using-php-slim-and-mysql-day-23/</a>",0

15806_irc_angularjs,deiu,DigitallyBorn: should I do that before defining the controllers?,0
15806_irc_angularjs,DigitallyBorn,"deiu: Define a factory in your app that returns an object with your shared variables, then have that factory injected into both controllers",0
15806_irc_angularjs,deiu,"DigitallyBorn: got it, thanks!",0
15806_irc_angularjs,DigitallyBorn,deiu: The order that it's defined isn't important. All the definitions are made before any controller code is invoked.,0
16003_irc_angularjs,greengriminal,is there an easy way to deter if a function has been called or not?,1
16003_irc_angularjs,y|haimo,defer is a function; can plnkr it?,2
16003_irc_angularjs,greengriminal,"I have a directive and inside this directive i want to do a check to say ""if x function hasn't been called then do"" y",0
16003_irc_angularjs,s3shs,"greengriminal, you can set a variable that's visible to both places.; And defer is a function? typeof $q.defer; type of; Sorry, one word for that, not two.; And if you call it from the console, just for kicks?; Sure.; And what if you step in to that statement in your code? I'm wondering if the error is coning from someplace else and the debugger is confused.; Reload. Step in.; It works from the console. So something else is wrong.; Ok, step in to resolve.; And that is the limit of my knowledge.; What version of angular?",0
16003_irc_angularjs,greengriminal,"s3shs: How do you mean set a variable that is in both places? Are you suggesting to set a variable ""is_called = false"" in my controller and then set the variable ""is_called"" in my directive also.",0
16003_irc_angularjs,s3shs,Yes. Or perhaps in the second place you can check the same condition that caused you to call the function in the first place.; 1.2.9?; They're up to 1.2.16. Might help.; (I need to run out.); Sure. Sorry.,0
16142_irc_angularjs,ner0x,Anyone know of any good $q tutorials or explanations?,1

16142_irc_angularjs,snurfery,you're very welcome. That whole page is just crammed full of the good stuff,0
16142_irc_angularjs,ner0x,snurfery: Would I use $q to do an accept/cancel dialog box in foundation? Or does that sound like something it should/would be used for?,0
16218_irc_angularjs,abstrakt,"anyone know what version of Angular <a href=""http://pub.dartlang.org/packages/angular"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://pub.dartlang.org/packages/angular</a> is equivalent to?; like, does that page mean that AngularDart is only as current with AngularJS itself as AngularJS 0.11? or is 0.11 merely the dart specific version?",1
16218_irc_angularjs,wafflejock_,that's the angular dart version 0.11.0 not angular version,2
16218_irc_angularjs,abstrakt,"ok, so how do I know what version of angular angulardart is compatible with?; like do/can I use angular 1.2 things? angular 1.3 things?; I'm liking the idea of Dart, and Angular 2.0 is supposed to be dart compatible; should I go Dart or just ECMA6 with like Traceur; ?; I'm leaning towards Dart at the moment",0
16218_irc_angularjs,wafflejock_,"not sure <a href=""https://docs.angulardart.org/#home"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://docs.angulardart.org/#home</a>",0
16218_irc_angularjs,abstrakt,"wafflejock_, do you use either EC6 or Dart?",0
16218_irc_angularjs,wafflejock_,nope,0
16218_irc_angularjs,abstrakt,k,0
16218_irc_angularjs,wafflejock_,robdubya: here uses traceur and like EC6 I know; but not sure if he's used dart to compare or not; likes*; abstrakt: personally I would probably go traceur but would need to read up more to really decide,0
16218_irc_angularjs,abstrakt,"wafflejock_, right on, hard to decide - I prefer the idea of going EC6, but if I had to choose something to start building a project right now I might go Dart; I guess it depends on how good Traceur is in terms of features and speed and overall EC6 compatibility",0
16218_irc_angularjs,wafflejock_,"abstrakt: yeah I mean it just ""down compiles"" to ECMA5 compatible stuff think it's sort of the same with Dart anyhow",0
16218_irc_angularjs,abstrakt,I dislike the idea of investing in a language that's not javascript when javascript is going to be evolving/gettinb etter soon,0
16218_irc_angularjs,wafflejock_,yeah,0
16218_irc_angularjs,abstrakt,"but at the same time, dart sounds quite promising given that we're not super close to an EC6 standard across the board",0
16218_irc_angularjs,wafflejock_,eh it will probably happen pretty fast,0
16218_irc_angularjs,abstrakt,cuz it is compatible with I think IE9 even,0
16218_irc_angularjs,wafflejock_,yeah depends on if that matters er how much that matters,0
16218_irc_angularjs,abstrakt,then again Angular 2.0 will require EC6 iirc,0
16218_irc_angularjs,wafflejock_,"yeah or at least traceur; <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14555389/is-interent-explorer-9-an-evergreen-browser-what-about-ie-10"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14555389/is-interent-explorer-9-an-evergreen-browser-what-about-ie-10</a>; good enough; hiya",0
16218_irc_angularjs,abstrakt,"wafflejock_, yeah if I can help it I will be enforcing we only support IE10 and better on any new projects; possibly even trying to say e.g. ""chrome only"" if I can get away with it, like if it's an internal app",0
16218_irc_angularjs,wafflejock_,abstrakt: yeah; abstrakt: haha just reminded me of the days of IE only sites :P,0
16218_irc_angularjs,abstrakt,ugh; nutscrape navigator ftw; 2.0 for evar!; :),0
16218_irc_angularjs,wafflejock_,"abstrakt: yeah loved netscape, loved firefox, love chrome",0
16218_irc_angularjs,abstrakt,"can I use Traceur right now with angular?; and or is there any reason I can't or that I shouldn't?; seems I probably won't benefit much from the class syntax for example, given how angular declares modules and injections",0

16218_irc_angularjs,abstrakt,"yeah I use a lot of Base whatevers, baseview basemodel, etc, in my backbone apps right now; dependency injection seems to remove as much need for that though",0
16218_irc_angularjs,wafflejock_,yeah I haven't done much of that in my angular apps but I'm sure i could get rid of some boilerplate in the process; just learned about vagrant too that's pretty dern cool,0
16218_irc_angularjs,abstrakt,"hmm, quite unrelated to most of this, I should think, but yeah vagrant is nice",0
16218_irc_angularjs,wafflejock_,gotta learn how to setup the config for em myself sometime but seems like it might be an intense task,0
16218_irc_angularjs,abstrakt,"I've been a chef user for a while; wafflejock_, nah, just learn chef",0
16218_irc_angularjs,wafflejock_,"abstrakt: eh alright will have to compare em, why you think it's better?",0
16218_irc_angularjs,abstrakt,"wafflejock_, no no, vagrant runs on chef; that's why learn chef",0
16218_irc_angularjs,wafflejock_,ah okay; gotcha,0
16218_irc_angularjs,abstrakt,"aside from IE testing which I avoid like the plague, I don't really need VMs these days; at least, as long as I'm not developing on windows, which I haven't had to for a long time",0
16218_irc_angularjs,wafflejock_,abstrakt: well it's nice for teams developing; abstrakt: I just vagrant up and have a server ready to go that everyone can use,0
16218_irc_angularjs,abstrakt,"right, and everyone has in theory the same environment",0
16218_irc_angularjs,wafflejock_,yeah; I like it,0
16218_irc_angularjs,abstrakt,"I've had issues with that in the past, but the same is said if everyone's on e.g. OSX; (which everyone I work with is right now)",0
16218_irc_angularjs,wafflejock_,ah I'm kubuntu,0
16218_irc_angularjs,abstrakt,and my *nix box hasn't behaved any differently than the OSX setups; it's pretty consistent across the board with e.g. ruby and node apps,0
16218_irc_angularjs,wafflejock_,but seems to work fine I think the guys I'm working with are OS X not sure though,0
16218_irc_angularjs,abstrakt,"yeah I don't think there's a massively compelling reason to force everyone to use the same vm image just so they can all work in the ""same environment""; as long as the system is *nix based it's all good",0
16218_irc_angularjs,wafflejock_,abstrakt: well I've been in shops where the setup is like a few days; abstrakt: so compared to that vagrant up was nice,0
16218_irc_angularjs,abstrakt,"ah, well in that case, sure",0

16544_irc_angularjs,Jdubs,"Hey guys o/; quick question; I want to build a modular bootstrap modal that will be used in place of javascript confirmation dialogs. In other words, I want it to show whatever HTML and/or text I give it in the box, with two yes/no buttons at the bottom. Yes will run a given yes function, no will run a given no function. What is the best way to pass the data to such a modal?",1
16544_irc_angularjs,kemm0,the best way to do that Jdubs is to just use ui-boostrap or angular-strap and save yourself a shitload of time; don't reinvent the wheel; or if you want to reinvent the wheel just look at the one that has allready been built,2
16544_irc_angularjs,Jdubs,kemm0: I have angular-strap does it have a confirmation dialog like what I'm asking?,0
16544_irc_angularjs,kemm0,if you build one it does; it's goign to provide you the ability to open a model; its up to you to put what you want in there; break it up into if statements; if/else statements; and use the proper logical evaluators,0
16544_irc_angularjs,Jdubs,"kemm0: yeah I've used it before, but the only way I can see to get the data to the core function would be to put everything on the rootscope is that right?",0
16544_irc_angularjs,kemm0,no,0

17019_irc_angularjs,Fishy,Does anyone have an example for form validation for a login? I cant find and example of validating username and password match after submit.,1
17019_irc_angularjs,mattupstate,Fishy: that would be done on the server side,2
17019_irc_angularjs,Fishy,mattupstate: i understand that.. but im not sure how to display an error from a controller,0
17019_irc_angularjs,mattupstate,"well thats a different question ;); and depends on what your serve returns when an invalid username/password pair is supplied; Fishy: but generally speaking, your server should return a 400 status code when the username and password is incorrect and you can simply show ""Invalid username or password"" as an error message in your UI",0
17019_irc_angularjs,jcabrea1121,"Fishy you can use this: return $http({ method: 'POST', url: 'service/login' }). then(function (response) { if (response.data.length> 0) { $scope.error_response = response.feedback; } });",0
17019_irc_angularjs,Fishy,"mattupstate: i can make a 400 error... but i have no idea how to link a error on form to ""if 400 error returned""",0
17019_irc_angularjs,mattupstate,"so just have something on the scope for your login UI that indicates if there was an error or not, and set it on the error handler for your $http.post call",0
17019_irc_angularjs,Fishy,"mattupstate: so ""$scope.error_response"" is just a element with the name of ""error_response"" on the form",0
17019_irc_angularjs,mattupstate,Fishy: i didn't suggest that; someone else did,0
17019_irc_angularjs,Fishy,mattupstate: sorry im completely new to this..,0

17019_irc_angularjs,jcabrea1121,"Fishy, $scope.error_response can be &lt;p class=""error_class""&gt;{{error_response}} &lt;/p> on your form to return the ""server side"" response from your server",0
17019_irc_angularjs,Fishy,mattupstate: i can do the HTTP part could you just show me how to display a error from a controller?; jcabrea1121: that makes sense! now we getting somewhere,0
17019_irc_angularjs,mattupstate,Fishy: it's just basic scope + template work,0
17019_irc_angularjs,jcabrea1121,IS use this: $scope.reLoad = function () { window.location.reload() };; ISH use this: $scope.reLoad = function () { window.location.reload() };,0

17314_irc_angularjs,LRFalk01,I'm looking to have my angular app get role permissions from the server and use those permissions client side. only show options user has access to etc. What's the recommended way of storing global information such as this?,1
17314_irc_angularjs,jcabrea0001,@LRFalk01 you can use LocalStorage like lawnchair js; @LRFalk however i dont reccomend doing it. Instead you query the server for permission when making requests on that Service,2
17314_irc_angularjs,LRFalk01,jcabrea0001: I appreciate your input. I do not think localstorage is the right approach. I am less looking for the how or when to get the information. I am more asking if there is a clean way to have some soft of global information in angular for your app that does not require me to inject something like a UserRoleService in all of my controllers.,0
17314_irc_angularjs,jcabrea0001,Would your Global permission require to be updated when admin changes the role? It could be an issue.,0
17314_irc_angularjs,LRFalk01,"jcabrea0001: roles are encrypted in the auth cookie, so if a user's roles were to change, they would need to log out and back in for them to take effect. at that point this angular app has effectively been restarted.",0

18351_irc_angularjs,rq60,jplussier: using scope: {} makes an isolate scope so you won't have access to your outer controller unless you pass them through that scope object as parameters,2

18351_irc_angularjs,jplussier,"Oh okay sweet; yay, thanks, that worked great; rq60: so, maybe a better question, it seems weird that I've got a controller function that I pass to the $scope and then expose again to the directive, can I just put functions in the directive itself somehow...?",0

24642_irc_angularjs,QuantumNinja,Is there an easy way of setting the page title in the head on pages where the content is pulled from JSON?; Ok I read putting a controller there is bad; Part of the issue is I have landing pages and then content pages; the landing pages are basically html templates and I found a method of doing the titles through the config in the app; but the dynamic stuff is where the problem lies,1
24642_irc_angularjs,Zerot,"QuantumNinja: if the variable is bound in the title tag, then you can just change the var to change the title. regardless of where the data comes from or when it is changed",2
24642_irc_angularjs,QuantumNinja,ok will give that a shot,0
24642_irc_angularjs,Zerot,QuantumNinja: The biggest problem is that you need a controller/scope that encompasses both the title tag and your content pages; QuantumNinja: so for this it makes sense to use $rootScope for it. (though it would probably be cleaner to make it a directive that gets its data from a service),0
24642_irc_angularjs,QuantumNinja,Zerot the content is already coming from a service; I might just try creating a hidden div with the content I need in it and then bind that to the head,0
24642_irc_angularjs,Zerot,QuantumNinja: ???? why would you need a div?,0
24642_irc_angularjs,QuantumNinja,well something; something to contain that data,0
24642_irc_angularjs,Zerot,"QuantumNinja: also, the service I was talking about is not your data service. but a title specific service that the title specific directive would use for the title",0
24642_irc_angularjs,QuantumNinja,I did have a service running that,0
24642_irc_angularjs,Zerot,QuantumNinja: data does not belong in the DOM if it is not visible,0

24851_irc_angularjs,Asiajey,what is the best way to create many elements with common ng-click action ?; without determinate of element other behaviour,1
24851_irc_angularjs,wafflejock,Asiajey: you can write a directive but unless you're using it a ton I think I'd prefer to just have an ng-click since it's obvious to people; Asiajey: typically I'll make directives for things I see as components or if I see a block of code I'm repeating a ton,2
24851_irc_angularjs,Asiajey,"wafflejock: i not sure about directive, it looks complex to me to use $compile staff and i not sure if it will work propertly, for example i would to create a bunch of div with ng-repeat wich will react on click as $scope.clicked=!$scope.clicked; for example this <a href=""http://plnkr.co/edit/gl1SVX3w5q1IqbLCBxUq?p=preview"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://plnkr.co/edit/gl1SVX3w5q1IqbLCBxUq?p=preview</a>",0
24851_irc_angularjs,wafflejock,"Asiajey: if you're worried about how to store data per element with an ng-repeat you typically use the iterant, so something like ng-click=""doStuffToUser(user)""",0
24851_irc_angularjs,Asiajey,"in fact, i tried to adopt the <a href=""https://github.com/randallb/angular-hammer"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://github.com/randallb/angular-hammer</a> to make draggable widget, but starting to think thatusing hammerjs in raw would be simpler; wafflejock: becaue it looks that injecting attribute directive is not very easy way",0
24851_irc_angularjs,wafflejock,"Asiajey: typically if someone has started working on a directive for some project it's probably needed, if you're going to use some third party stuff not already built to work within angular then it's going to need to be wrapped in a service or directive to play nice within angular",0
24851_irc_angularjs,chexxor,"`ng-if` doesn't remove the directive it contains, but `ng-show` *does*. Why? - <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/6HcGS/593/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://jsfiddle.net/6HcGS/593/</a> (click the clear button)",0
24851_irc_angularjs,caitp,because that version doesn't have ng-if,0
24851_irc_angularjs,wafflejock,"Angular needs to be aware of changes to the model and needs to have a $digest triggered in order to update the things bound to the model, it also does DOM manipulation and changes CSS classes so other libraries or code that does those things will be more problematic",0
24851_irc_angularjs,caitp,1.0.2 is old,0
24851_irc_angularjs,chexxor,"It's related to ng-if creating a new scope, but I can't figure out how that matters",0
24851_irc_angularjs,Asiajey,"wafflejock: yes, this is a question, what should be easer - to use already created directive, or make own one ?",0
24851_irc_angularjs,wafflejock,Asiajey: since the project looks somewhat active typically better to build on the shoulders of others,0
24851_irc_angularjs,chexxor,"caitp, holy eff - wow. nice find",0
24851_irc_angularjs,wafflejock,unless it's a complete mess your better off at least learning how they approached it to understand why it's wrong or bad before re-writing,0

24851_irc_angularjs,wafflejock,chexxor: better to use plnkr.co; IMO,0
24851_irc_angularjs,Asiajey,"wafflejock: yes, but it declares directives, and if I want to create own directive I have to compile it's directives to own directive, and it not looks easer, I think i missing something.",0
24851_irc_angularjs,wafflejock,"Asiajey: if you use someone else's directives in the template of your directive it gets compiled, but I'm also saying you can build within their source to create what you need if it isn't there too; Asiajey: regardless you're going to need to deal with interfacing with the other library but if the existing code gives you access to information more easily it's worth using, if not then do it from scratch but my guess is that's rare, usually there will be some overlap",0
24851_irc_angularjs,Asiajey,wafflejock: but what is common way ? for example if i need to add a click action to directive ?,0
24851_irc_angularjs,wafflejock,"Asiajey: you just use an ng-click to add a click to an element, if you want your own directive you just bind to the click event on the element and call a function which could be passed in (this is what ng-click does); scope:{ngClick:""&amp;""} //it does something like this then in link:function(iElem){iElem.on(""click"", function(event){ngClick(event)})} //real code is likely smarter than this",0
24851_irc_angularjs,Asiajey,"wafflejock: ok, thanks, so it is correct way to use event bindings instead of directives melting if it possible",0

25536_irc_angularjs,robdubya,...of the same thing?,0
25536_irc_angularjs,shacklef_,what do mean; back up; think of 2 arrays; one that has dates; and the 2nd has names; the dates are hard coded in an array; and the names come from a service,0
25536_irc_angularjs,robdubya,great. whats the relationship between them,0
25536_irc_angularjs,shacklef_,but the goal is to populate a single table,0
25536_irc_angularjs,robdubya,you're putting them in a tableview. the same table. they're obviously related somehow,0

25536_irc_angularjs,robdubya,"no, its not",0
25536_irc_angularjs,shacklef_,i dont see how the relationship matters; it could be letters in one array and numbers in a second,0

25536_irc_angularjs,robdubya,"okay, how about this. what should the end result look like?; forget about angular for a second",0
25536_irc_angularjs,shacklef_,"in a table, the first column will have 1,2,3,4; and the second column has A,B,C,D; 1,2,3,4 will be populated by ng-repeat, from a service",0

27913_irc_angularjs,wafflejock,S234567a: if you really want page validation you can use data- prefix; angular will strip it when looking for directives; I personally don't give a damn if it's validated though,0

28183_irc_angularjs,mikehaas763,"wafflejock: Ya we actually use vagrant, I guess I could configure the provisioning to just go clone the api repo and spin it up",0
28183_irc_angularjs,wafflejock,"mikehaas763: yeah that's how it's done on a project I'm on now and it works pretty well; mikehaas763: we just had to clone the repo, run vagrant up, wait for a bit and pretty much (couple steps here to update composer dependencies, probably could be automated) everything up and running",0

28183_irc_angularjs,zelrik,I have done some,0
28183_irc_angularjs,wafflejock,I like Slim PHP though and eloquent is pretty nice,0
28183_irc_angularjs,zelrik,but nothing really advanced,0
28183_irc_angularjs,wafflejock,haven't messed with laravel,0
28183_irc_angularjs,mikehaas763,zelrik: learn it and realize the only time it's the right tool for the job is when a shop only has access to php devs,0
28183_irc_angularjs,zelrik,I have heard php is quite faster than RoR though mikehaas763,0
28183_irc_angularjs,mikehaas763,"zelrik: execution speed? doubtful. They both suck at performance and require caching layers, etc",0
28183_irc_angularjs,zelrik,"mikehaas763, what a performant backend then",0
28183_irc_angularjs,wafflejock,zelrik: it's almost always a matter of how you use a language when it comes to speed.... PHP is written in C so it's pretty performant and if you do everything right you can make it fast; zelrik: but it has to spin up the interpreter every time; zelrik: Java is persistent which can be good when you need to keep re-using data in memory,0
28183_irc_angularjs,zelrik,java code looks like hell though,0
28183_irc_angularjs,mikehaas763,wafflejock: I don't know of any descent fairly commonly used languages whose runtimes are not written in C,0
28183_irc_angularjs,wafflejock,mikehaas763: I thought about that after I wrote it :P; but just sayin it's not running through a VM,0
28183_irc_angularjs,mikehaas763,java code looks a lot better than php. You're probably referring to its strictly typed nature,0
28183_irc_angularjs,wafflejock,"yeah I agree with mikehaas763 here too; Java is pretty great if you like OOP but I've just had to fight with Tomcat so much, and PHP is just easier to deal with unless you need something that requires WebSphere or some other kind of mass distribution; and just haven't dug into Node yet so can't really speak to that",0
28183_irc_angularjs,mikehaas763,wafflejock: Lately I've been using play framework and spring frameworks built in abilities to build themselves as a standalone executable with the server embedded. It's made things much easier,0

28183_irc_angularjs,mikehaas763,"zelrik: That verbosity generally means a more stable codebase though; I generally prefer to keep hard business rules and domain logic in a strictly typed language like java, c# etc.",0
28183_irc_angularjs,zelrik,I wanna learn more C# if I have the opportunity,0
28183_irc_angularjs,robdubya,"that makes it more ""enterprise""; (whatever that means)",0

28183_irc_angularjs,mikehaas763,robdubya: It makes it more stable is what it does,0

28183_irc_angularjs,mikehaas763,"futures, the term used before promises became popular lol; I can't remember when but java has had the futures library for a very long time now",0
28183_irc_angularjs,zelrik,The thing about C# is that it means .NET,0
28183_irc_angularjs,wafflejock,yeah I generally stay away from that,0

28183_irc_angularjs,wafflejock,"zelrik: me neither I don't think anyone does; zelrik: but if you're looking for performance comparison of a bunch of languages and frameworks that's the best I've seen; zelrik: pretty interesting article I got to that link through as well <a href=""http://www.infoworld.com/t/java-programming/surprise-java-fastest-server-side-web-apps-230565"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.infoworld.com/t/java-programming/surprise-java-fastest-server-side-web-apps-230565</a> others have posted the graphs but the article does a pretty good job of talking about the other points of why a framework is chosen; They say PHP runs 35% of the internet which is probably true given WordPress accounts for something like 22% of sites (assuming they are both looking at top 10 million sites); there are a lot of existing things you can build on top of or integrate with using PHP but it was definitely used to write a lot of view code which I'm pretty against at this point (not saying I never did it)",0

28310_irc_angularjs,Hounddog,or requirejs,0
28310_irc_angularjs,Aartsie,"robdubya: yes i have that to but every submodule has a map controllers, views and services",0

28544_irc_angularjs,wafflejock,sal1191: typically with resolve you return the promise itself and the state/route change is delayed until the promise returns a result and that's what will be injected,2

28582_irc_angularjs,pream,What is your approach to adapters?,0
28582_irc_angularjs,robdubya,adapters expose CRUD; so all adapters should have the same external API,0

28878_irc_angularjs,robdubya,yeah. they are two distinct things,0
28878_irc_angularjs,Strues,"Thought so. I totally lied, one more thing. The request I did in Postman successfully submitted to my database, but like I said only submitted _id __v. This is just because I dont have anything defined, correct?",0
28878_irc_angularjs,robdubya,"presumably, but i dont know what fullstack is doing server side really.; i imagine there's a ""model"" or a ""schema"" with attributes you define",0

28878_irc_angularjs,robdubya,"Strues the way to think about js fullstack stuff is; your job is basically to move objects from server to client and back again; so its less about ""posting forms"" and more about ""saving objects""; form is an interface, what's relevant here is the *model* (object / foo / etc) that the form modifys; uh, modifies",0

The view that's loaded goes in content.; Hmm...looks like if I can find a way to modify the $scope variable in the header controller, I'd be golden...; How can I make a variable in one controller dependent on loading a completely different view?; Or better yet, is it possible for a child controller to access a parent controller's scope?",0
29194_irc_angularjs,zelrik,"damoncasale, it s happens by default; controllers inherit from each other; whenever they are nested",2
29194_irc_angularjs,damoncasale,"So if I say, $scope.pagename = ""FEED"" inside the child controller, it'll affect the pagename variable in the parent controller?",0

29194_irc_angularjs,damoncasale,Ah.; Ok.,0
29194_irc_angularjs,zelrik,usually I use services though; makes life so much easier,0
29194_irc_angularjs,damoncasale,How would I do that with a service?; Or should I just do it with a resolve somehow?,0
29194_irc_angularjs,zelrik,"you inject the service into the parent controller; then do $scope.myService = MyService;; then you ll have access to the service in all child controllers; if you have 2 controllers in parallel, you just inject the service in both; and assign it to both scopes; if you start messing with $parent etc, things get complicated; I dont know enough to use those properly; I have been using angularJS for only 6 months",0

29194_irc_angularjs,zelrik,"that might be wrong; I usually define a whole object with its properties in the factory, then I return the whole object; var object = {}; object.pagename = ... return object;; I like things to be self contained; and I think angular likes that too",0
29194_irc_angularjs,damoncasale,I'm returning getters and setters. Why is that wrong?,0
29194_irc_angularjs,zelrik,damn there is so much code to go through :p; hold on I ll try to build a small example,0
29194_irc_angularjs,damoncasale,"Hmm. Had to manually set a watch on it.; That's odd.; I did get it to work, tho.; That's kind of weird, but w/e.",0
29194_irc_angularjs,zelrik,"damoncasale, <a href=""http://plnkr.co/edit/GJiKewkZu7jA0Xwv9ujx?p=preview"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://plnkr.co/edit/GJiKewkZu7jA0Xwv9ujx?p=preview</a>; With only those basic stuff, you can go pretty far; damoncasale, did you see my plnkr",0
29194_irc_angularjs,damoncasale,Yes.; Thanks.,0
29213_irc_angularjs,damoncasale,"Hmm. Got pulled away earlier, so didn't get a chance to follow up on my earlier question about AJAX calls.; I have a ""mail"" view which needs to pull in a collection of ""mail"" items to render in the template. Each and every time the view is loaded, I need to re-load this collection (because it might change, get new emails, etc.). What's the best way of getting that resource?; Still very new at Angular. I'm none too familiar with how it works, only that simply using a resolve won't necessarily do the trick, since the resolve only fires once, the first time the view is loaded, if I understand correctly.",1
29213_irc_angularjs,wafflejock_,damoncasale: you can just put the $http or $resource calls or whatever your using in the controllers and each time a view is visited (assuming ngRoute or ui-router here) the controller will be recreated and so the calls will happen again,2
29213_irc_angularjs,damoncasale,"Okay, but then how will the template values be loaded and rendered?",1
29213_irc_angularjs,wafflejock_,damoncasale: resolve will also work it just fires before the view is loaded... typically I still wrap up API calls in a service and will just explicitly make the call from controllers where I want updates to happen,0
29213_irc_angularjs,damoncasale,"For instance, one of my template variables is {{ screenname }}.",0
29213_irc_angularjs,wafflejock_,damoncasale: well using {{}} sets up a watcher so once screenname gets populated on whatever scope that element belongs to and a digest cycles is run in angular then the display automatically updates,0
29213_irc_angularjs,damoncasale,"Well, it's in an ng-repeat.",0
29213_irc_angularjs,wafflejock_,damoncasale: things like $http automatically call $scope.$apply for you which triggers a digest,0
29213_irc_angularjs,damoncasale,"So how will that work, if the collection hasn't been loaded yet?",0
29213_irc_angularjs,wafflejock_,damoncasale: it's okay the bindings in angular will handle that,0
29213_irc_angularjs,damoncasale,Okay.,0
29213_irc_angularjs,wafflejock_,it's smart enough to ignore that it's not there immediately,0
29213_irc_angularjs,damoncasale,So is there a good syntax example for doing $http in a resolve?,0
29213_irc_angularjs,wafflejock_,damoncasale: with a resolve it just expects a pattern where you have a property name as the name that will be used for injecting the resolved object into a controller and on the value side a promise that resolves to whatever data you want,0
29213_irc_angularjs,damoncasale,"Is $q the same as $scope, or what?",0
29213_irc_angularjs,wafflejock_,"function loadUser(){ $http.get('getUserData.php') }; so something like resolve: {user: ['UserService', function(UserService){return UserService.loadUser()}}; assuming you have a UserService object and the loadUser method returns a promise; damoncasale: nope all the angular services start with $ but scope is a different beast; damoncasale: $q is a service that allows you to create promises; a promise is an object that can be resolved or rejected at some later time very useful for async stuff like ajax calls; angular scopes basically provide a hierarchy for the controllers and other sections of your app that need to have their own way to reference data or have functions that can be called from your view",0
29213_irc_angularjs,damoncasale,wafflejock_: Do you mean loadUser() { return $http.get('blah'); } ?,0
29213_irc_angularjs,wafflejock_,damoncasale: yes,0
29213_irc_angularjs,damoncasale,"Didn't see a return in there, just checking.",0
29213_irc_angularjs,wafflejock_,"damoncasale: good catch, $http returns an HTTPPromise",0
29213_irc_angularjs,damoncasale,"k, now that's starting to make sense.",0
29213_irc_angularjs,wafflejock_,"damoncasale: I should probably have said $ is the prefix for all the providers since services and factories and values are providers but not all providers are a factory or service, so there may be some of those that are just defined as providers not services necessarily <a href=""https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/src/ng/http.js#L88"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/src/ng/http.js#L88</a>; damoncasale: there's also pretty good docs on how the scope works and what you use it for here <a href=""https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/scope"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/scope</a>",0

30096_irc_angularjs,volk_,"hey guys just wondering, what is the best practice for helper functions that act on an angular value? should they be in a service or a factory?",1
30096_irc_angularjs,s3shs,"volk_, how widespread will the functions be used.; ?",0
30096_irc_angularjs,jaawerth,"volk_: Well, a service and a factory are so close to being the same thing (and you can use module.factory to create a service) that it's hard to answer that question",2
30096_irc_angularjs,volk_,s3shs: maybe in a few controllers,0
30096_irc_angularjs,jaawerth,volk_: but usually you'd just use a factory if they're simply helper functions,0
30096_irc_angularjs,volk_,"@jaawerth, ah..okay thanks.",0
30096_irc_angularjs,s3shs,"volk_, there's no rule that says you can't put functions in a service object.",0
30096_irc_angularjs,jaawerth,"volk_: basically a service is just a factory where ""new"" is invoked on the returned singleton",0
30096_irc_angularjs,volk_,"s3shs i know theres no rule but im just thinking of best/most logical practices; jaawerth: yeah so i figure if youre making new instances with helper fucntions, that probably wouldnt make sense; right",0
30096_irc_angularjs,s3shs,"volk_, true best practice would have both the data and the functions that act on it in the same service and allow the service to act as an object.",0
30096_irc_angularjs,volk_,s3shs: ah interesting; s3shs: that actually makes sense. thanks,0
30096_irc_angularjs,jaawerth,"volk_: exactly. A factory would be the way to go. A service would be when you want a singleton object, a factory would be a constructor (or some other kind of useful function)",0
30096_irc_angularjs,s3shs,Ooh! Something I said made sense! First time for everything. ;-),0
30096_irc_angularjs,volk_,jaawerth: are you sure you got that right? im pretty sure a facotry would be when you want a singleton object since you can `new` services; s3shs: :),0
30096_irc_angularjs,jaawerth,"yeah; basically when you use app.service it's the same thing as using app.factory and doing ""return new MyConstructor();"" at the end",0
30096_irc_angularjs,s3shs,^ jaawerth,0
30096_irc_angularjs,jaawerth,but you only really need new when it's a complex object,0
30096_irc_angularjs,volk_,"jaawerth: right exactly, so if youre retruning a new constuctor, then you have a whole new object which would not be a singleton",0
30096_irc_angularjs,s3shs,"I still create services the ""old"" way. :-\",0
30096_irc_angularjs,jaawerth,"I thought you just wanted helper functions?; if a helper function is tied to a specific ""data type"" then it makes sense to put it in an object",0
30096_irc_angularjs,volk_,jaawerth: well now im just talking in general,0
30096_irc_angularjs,jaawerth,"ah; well, I actually do both; I keep a factory that returns the constructor function so I can make instances, and then for the service, I inject the factory and return new; depending on what exactly I'm doing; that also makes it easy to do configuration, data-protection, class inheritance, etc",0
30096_irc_angularjs,volk_,ah i see,0
30096_irc_angularjs,s3shs,"Wait a minute, the factory that returns an object is only called once.; Or am I missing something?",0
30096_irc_angularjs,jaawerth,"s3shs: remember, a function is an object. If you return a constructor function, you can use that to instantiate multiple objects, or inject it into another factory that returns a singleton",0
30096_irc_angularjs,s3shs,"jaawerth, oh I see what you're saying. Cool.",0

When I deploy my web app, I concat/minify all of my application JS as well as views (in a $templatecache), but I want to make sure my users are using the latest version when I push a new copy.; I was considering having the RESTful API have a custom version header, to bounce against the client version, to ensure they're in sync... wasn't sure if there's a better way that anyone else has used",1
33646_irc_angularjs,progrock,"giannico83: if youa re using grunt you can user 'rev' to version your minified and concatenated files with a unique key; that way you can cache files for as long as you want, since when there is a change, tehre will be a unique key in the name of the file",2
33646_irc_angularjs,giannico83,@progrock - if a user is in the process of using the application though - what would be the key to invalidating their copy?,0
33646_irc_angularjs,progrock,"oh, that;s different... they wouldhave to reload the index 9assuming it's a single page app); I dn.. can;t say I;ve ever had that concern",0
33646_irc_angularjs,giannico83,"k, i was thinking maybe i'd bump a version in the RESTful API, and the client would expect a certain version of the API",0
33646_irc_angularjs,progrock,"yeah, I guess you could use web sockets or something, which would revert down to polling if not available in the browser; but fuck people using browser that don;t support web sickets, lol",0
33646_irc_angularjs,giannico83,"hahaha, i don't expect i'll be pushing changes very often - so not a huge concern",0
33646_irc_angularjs,progrock,"man, I literally can;t figure out the correct way to use angularFire/firebase to select my user's object (at the root of my collection) as an array",0
33646_irc_angularjs,giannico83,"but when i do push some breaking changes to the API, just trying to figure out the best way to invalidate any older clients that might be in progress",0
33646_irc_angularjs,progrock,"I know to do .$asArray().. but I need to select the users first, and I don;t see any command for that in the api.. so weird",0
33646_irc_angularjs,giannico83,progrock - i have a little bit of firebase experience - why are you trying to select it as an array?,0
33646_irc_angularjs,progrock,"giannico83: it's an array of users thaat I will be listing; giannico83: secting it as anArray isn;t really what I'm confused about.. its how i first select the 'users' key, so I can then call $asArray",0
33646_irc_angularjs,giannico83,"@progrock i hardly used arrays at all, mostly used objects in the little bit of data that i did represent... the API seems simple, what kind of error are you getting?",0
33646_irc_angularjs,progrock,giannico83: I think its jsut that child is not on the $firebase obect.. I thi nk I got it... $firebsae(firebaseRef.child('users')).$asArray(),0
33646_irc_angularjs,giannico83,gotcha,0
33646_irc_angularjs,progrock,"maybe; maybe not, lol; oh yeah it worked; just gotta get ued to where I can use $firebase and where I need to use the non angularFire firebase object; I'm so beyond exhausted, just don;t have the speed to try 10 things guessing... practcally falling asleep at the keyboard",0
33646_irc_angularjs,giannico83,"yeah, i felt the same... i found myself wanting to just use it as a normal data store for a lot of things and not caring about the sync functionality (as awesome as it was); so i was either using the normal JS API, or i was using $firebase and turning events off immediately",0
33646_irc_angularjs,progrock,well the sync has it's uses... tho I'm only minimally making use of that here,0
33646_irc_angularjs,giannico83,"yeah, the sync is fantastic when you have a use case for it",0
33646_irc_angularjs,progrock,"I'm actually just using it since I'm too lazy to make a node backend and authenticate with github, and store some minor data in mongo; so much easier to just use firebase for now... and then if I decide not to when it goes live, I'll code the node/mongo/github api code",0
33646_irc_angularjs,giannico83,"that's what i was using it for, and then the app grew where i had to interact with other APIs (send email, take payments, etc.) and I entded up migrating off of it",0
33646_irc_angularjs,progrock,but I love howfirebase lets me ignore all the redious code I don;t want to write right now,0
33646_irc_angularjs,giannico83,"exactly, did the same thing... awesome for a POC; i started messing with Zapier a little bit too... to eliminate the need for node for interacting with other APIs; again, was impressed - but some limitations eventually led me back to the node/mongo stack",0
33646_irc_angularjs,progrock,"lol, I am so tired.. saw POC and was thinking POS, not Proof of concept",0
33646_irc_angularjs,giannico83,hahahahaha,0
33646_irc_angularjs,progrock,"Though firebase's sync may come in handy... basically setting up an app for a charting library I'm working on for me (and otehrs) to make examples, save them as gists... and be able to create, edit, and save new examples; might be cool to allow people to A) watch as an example is being coded, or even B) join in and collaboratively code examples",0
33646_irc_angularjs,giannico83,"yeah, that sounds perfect... the sync demos so nicely",0
33646_irc_angularjs,progrock,"would be great for helping new users... could pop on if I see someone struggling and help themout; would probably really surprise someone if they didn;t know it was a feature; But, aside from the sync 9which I could do with sockets eventually, tho prob wont have the time)... it will be easy enough to convert my firebase usage into node/mongo... just need to store users, and references to the gists that are examples",0

35060_irc_angularjs,kostiak,"hey. I'm starting to learn angular and trying to figure out what's the proper way for a controller to ""talk"" to a directive; like I have an isolated directive, I want a controller to ""read"" and ""write"" data in the directive; what's the right way to do that?; anyone?",1
35060_irc_angularjs,Arindam,@kostiak i think isolate scope with two way data binding via = would be the way to do it,2
35060_irc_angularjs,kostiak,Arindam: won't that affect other elemnts of the same directive?,0
35060_irc_angularjs,Arindam,you could probably stub out the response via a mock service; have you checked whats coming in via response?; kostiak: other elements of the same directive as in?,0
35060_irc_angularjs,kostiak,"like I have a directive that makes &lt;post&gt;&lt;/post> elements; I want a controller to be able to change stuff inside each post individually; (I'm very new to this, so if I'm doing something completely wrong, which is likely, please correct me on it); Like say I have &lt;post id=1&gt;&lt;/post&gt; and &lt;post id=2&gt;&lt;/post>; inside the post's template I have a ""text"" model, I want a controller to ""read"" the post's id and ""write"" the post's text",0
35060_irc_angularjs,Lorthirk,"@kostiak: ... It seems to me that you're using a directive for the only purpose of isolating a view, am I right?",0
35060_irc_angularjs,kostiak,"to be honest, I'm not sure; I'm very new, as I said",0
35060_irc_angularjs,Lorthirk,"Oh well, so am I :)",0
35060_irc_angularjs,kostiak,"so just trying to wrap my head around the whole concept; but yeah, I think I'm using the directive as an isolated view..",0
35060_irc_angularjs,Arindam,"instead of id it could be &lt;post article=""someArticle""&gt;&lt;/post> where someArticle is coming in to the directive via isolate scope with two way data binding; so any change made to someArticle including someAcrticle.text would reflect back into the controller and vice versa; so any change made to someArticle including someArticle.text would reflect back into the controller and vice versa",0
35060_irc_angularjs,Monkeytoe,"arindam, inside the postArticle function at the Article.query({}, function(response){$scope.articles = response;} }); I added in a console.log(response); before $scope.articles = response; and it is definantly returning the correct object",0
35060_irc_angularjs,Lorthirk,"kostiak, would you please post your directive?",0
35060_irc_angularjs,kostiak,"Lorthirk: ah, sure, but there's nothing special/smart about it; just playing around trying to figure stuff out",0
35060_irc_angularjs,Lorthirk,@kostiak however I guess you should be using the directive's scope for data interactions,0
35060_irc_angularjs,kostiak,"Lorthirk: yeah, honestly I think I doing this completely backwards somehow",0
35060_irc_angularjs,Lorthirk,"I think about a dirextive; directive as a isolated, reusable component; Which should be decoupled from any particular controller",0
35060_irc_angularjs,kostiak,right; with you so far,0
35060_irc_angularjs,Lorthirk,"So, since a directive has its own controller, why not letting it do all the work?",0
35060_irc_angularjs,kostiak,"well, if I'm thinking of a directive as a view, I don't think of it as ""doing the work"", I think of a (seperate) controller ""doing the work"" and the view only ""showing the work""; so that if I ever want to change the way I ""do the work"" I don't need to change the view, only the controller; at least theoretically; I might be wrong of course",0
35060_irc_angularjs,Foxandxss,kostiak: what Arindam said is correct,0
35060_irc_angularjs,kostiak,Foxandxss: can you be more specific?,0
35060_irc_angularjs,Foxandxss,pass stuff via attributes using = and @,0
35060_irc_angularjs,Lorthirk,"But again, this way you would be coupling the directive to some other controller, maybe killing its reusability",0
35060_irc_angularjs,Foxandxss,Lorthirk: doing what exactly?; I missed half of the conversation,0
35060_irc_angularjs,Lorthirk,"Well, it's just my point of view",0
35060_irc_angularjs,Foxandxss,but explain yourself; directives are decoupled from controllers if they are isolated,0
35060_irc_angularjs,Lorthirk,But putting the logic of a directive in another controller would mean that that directive could only live under that controller,0
35060_irc_angularjs,Foxandxss,nobody said that,0
35060_irc_angularjs,Lorthirk,(and that's why directives has their own controller),0
35060_irc_angularjs,Foxandxss,yes and no; but I follow you,0
35060_irc_angularjs,Lorthirk,"Well... That's all, more and less :) that's why I was thinking it was better to put the logic in the directive's controller",0
35060_irc_angularjs,Foxandxss,directive conttroller / link function; that is correct,0
35060_irc_angularjs,Lorthirk,"But as said before I am a total newbie too, so probably I'm missing several points here",0
35060_irc_angularjs,kostiak,yeah I think I figured something out,0

35060_irc_angularjs,ThatTreeOverTher,"yeah... the post directive represents a post, your controller handles the logic behind the posts",0
35060_irc_angularjs,Foxandxss,kostiak: jsfiddle is a piece of crap,0
35060_irc_angularjs,ThatTreeOverTher,plunker is far better but I wouldn't say jsfiddle is that bad; I mean it has an old version of Angular but that's about all I see...; ohhh I see why it's bad; you can't make more than one file; you just squash everything into all of the boxes which doesn't really play nice with Angular,0
35060_irc_angularjs,kostiak,"ThatTreeOverTher: yeah, it's for small samples; nothing more",0
35060_irc_angularjs,ThatTreeOverTher,"hah, apparently in plunker you can make an unnamed file, and it shows up as a little sliver in the files bar on the left",0
35060_irc_angularjs,kostiak,"ThatTreeOverTher: taking a second look at it, what's wrong with the ""padding-left""? Shouldn't it be part of the template?",0
35060_irc_angularjs,ThatTreeOverTher,it should be in your CSS file,0
35060_irc_angularjs,kostiak,"but it's part of the template of this particular ""component""; as in, I want it reusable regardless of the css I'm using on that page, no?",0
35060_irc_angularjs,ThatTreeOverTher,I mean it won't kill you not to put it in your CSS,0
35060_irc_angularjs,kostiak,"Neither is horrible, I'm just trying to see what's the better way",0
35060_irc_angularjs,ThatTreeOverTher,but let's say you wanted to separate your styles from your structure,0
35060_irc_angularjs,kostiak,ThatTreeOverTher: continue your thought...,0
35060_irc_angularjs,ThatTreeOverTher,"like let's say you wanted to be able to change the theme of the site at any moment (which is kind of a contrived example but oh well); you could serve up a different CSS file for the user, and that's it; your HTML doesn't have to know about what it looks like, it just has to have the right structure so it can be themed; plus it helps you stay organized, keeping your style logic in a separate file; that way if someone wants to design a new theme or something, they don't have to know Angular, just CSS",0
35060_irc_angularjs,kirfu,ThatTreeOverTher: I see what your saying but realistically to make a new theme you do need to be able to change the html behind it.; changing css alone will only get you soo far.,0
35060_irc_angularjs,ThatTreeOverTher,"right, but oftentimes that's enough for a designer; as long as you're not introducing entirely new components or actions into an app, just changing CSS can do a lot; honestly, slapping a box-shadow on your app will make it look 20% shinier; I did that for a bullet pointed list in Times New Roman and suddenly it looked nice",0

35308_irc_angularjs,jaawerth,"adrrr: I like using the array notation. I find it matches up with how the injection stuff actually works (passing in a set of functions by name), plus it allows me to alias the names of my dependencies (when it comes to controllers) when I want to; a lot of people find it annoying, but once you get used to it I really don't see how it gets in the way; plus it saves an extra step of pre-compiling; adrrr: I do sometimes use $inject when doing tests, though",0

35466_irc_angularjs,davek,"rayu, it has an ng-model that it assigns the selected date to.",2
35466_irc_angularjs,jaawerth,rayu: just define an update function on scope (or from a service - but if you define it on scope it should be calling a service anyway) and pass the row ID as a param,2
35466_irc_angularjs,chanced,rayu: put a watcher on the model (which you have in the view you linked),2
35466_irc_angularjs,jaawerth,rayu: and use ng-click or whatever event you want,2

35466_irc_angularjs,jaawerth,rayu: davek's also got a point; you could also just send all the ngmodels' data to the database at once,0

35819_irc_angularjs,Oddman,"morning all; Anyone know if it's possible to retrieve the name of a service?; I have a service that extends other services, and so the parent service needs to dynamically retrieve the name of the extended service",1
35819_irc_angularjs,davek,Oddman uhhh what?,0
35819_irc_angularjs,Oddman,"davek yeah I don't like that, because you're making assumptions without context; is it possible or not?; and if so, how?",0
35819_irc_angularjs,davek,Fuck those sentences were the exact same length.,0
35819_irc_angularjs,Oddman,haha true davek :P,0
35819_irc_angularjs,davek,"Oddman, if the child services inherit (I'm assuming inject + extend?) the parent service, they can set a shared variable on the service.; So they can register themselves with it.; That's my simplest solution. Though seriously... none of you feels that this is a weird solution?",0
35819_irc_angularjs,Oddman,"davek true, but I prefer a little magic in cases like this - it would be nice to be able to dynamically ascertain the name of the service being used; as it reduces redunancy and makes the code a lot dryer",0

35819_irc_angularjs,Oddman,"they're extended ng-resources; and at times, from withint he parent, I need to know what the name of the resource is - the least of which is for debugging/information, but in some cases needing to output the name of the resource being used in certain UI requirements",0

35819_irc_angularjs,Oddman,yeah that's not quite what I want though,0
35819_irc_angularjs,davek,So yes there are places that are accessible from code that contain the names of your modules.; Yeah because you can't explain or demonstrate what you want in an understandable way.,0
35819_irc_angularjs,Oddman,"I shall investigate further, it's probably on the this object somewhere... hehe; davek: class b extends a, a needs name of b. Simples.; just slightly more complicated in an angularjs service context, I've found :)",0

39657_irc_angularjs,irc_smirk,angular vs polymer . which is better?; yeah better; what does angular offer that polymer cant; seem polymer is the ultimate borg. embrace and extend; modularity / code organization?; have you used polymer?; modularity is exactly what its about; the two can work side to side but i havent found a compelling reason; other than browser that support it lol; i encourage everyone to look into polymer and web components. its the future,1

45703_irc_angularjs,Qvazar,Hi! My team has plans for a complete rebuild of a major scandinavian trading site next year. We've been looking around at possible SPA frameworks to use and found out that Angular 2 is in development! Do anyone know how this is going= Is it possibly going to be ready for 2015?,1
45703_irc_angularjs,joehannes,Qvazar ... not that I know about angular 2 ... but what does it make so different to you that you would consider it in v2 only?,2
45703_irc_angularjs,Qvazar,"joehannes, it's a complete rewrite; better routing, ES6, faster data binding, easier directives, just to name a few..; I can't find one",0
45703_irc_angularjs,joehannes,"Qvazar ... well, the most promising thing I've heard at some point is that at some point angular is to merge/incorporate polymer ... until then I for one am happy with it like it is; bigger better faster hyper ... baeehh; sorry for my prickness, am really tired",0
45703_irc_angularjs,Qvazar,joehannes :),0
45703_irc_angularjs,MalteJ,joehannes: I like polymer somehow.,0
45703_irc_angularjs,Qvazar,"and ng2 is mobile-first, which would be really good for our plans..",0
45703_irc_angularjs,joehannes,have you seen the paper elements (sorta polymer example lib)? that's good work!,0

45703_irc_angularjs,joehannes,"hmmm, well, I haven't been devving on ubuntu so far. with 14.10 there seems to be some kind of new framework though; they got this QT driven dev env ... or you can code html5/javascript",0

45703_irc_angularjs,joehannes,"MalteJ ... oh, it's too big for a plunkr ... would you mind me pastebinning the parts in question? or providing a non-functional plunkr?; yes, in the controllers directive definition",0
45703_irc_angularjs,MalteJ,I think it should be the other way round,0
45703_irc_angularjs,joehannes,MalteJ ... huh?; how come?; which other way ... and why around? and what?,0
45703_irc_angularjs,MalteJ,I'm new to angular and always have trouble with directives. But I think the require ^ does pull the parent controller into your current scope,0
45703_irc_angularjs,joehannes,"MalteJ ... oh, well, I'm not exactly new to angular, but this is a weak point of mine ... the docs say ^ allows for the required stuff to be a sibling basically, not a child (transcluded possibly) only; MalteJ ...

45890_irc_angularjs,wafflej0ck,"ephrion: not really clear what you need it to do vs what it's doing, you can possibly use notify() on the promise to trigger the handler but perhaps it should just be triggerred when the resolve happens depends on what the handler expects",2
45890_irc_angularjs,ephrion,"wafflej0ck: thanks!

45890_irc_angularjs,wafflej0ck,"so looks like callback is triggered any time there is a tag event, suppose you could use notify for this but once the resolve or reject happens on the deferred then I think the promise stops doing anything for notify() (not positive on that though)",0
45890_irc_angularjs,ephrion,Hmm. I need to do more studying of the Angular framework to figure out exactly what kind of behavior I want. Thanks for helping!,0
45890_irc_angularjs,wafflej0ck,"ephrion: yeah np, it might be that you just want to still use the callback but have a promise that you return instead of using the win/fail",0

46584_irc_angularjs,themime,is there a best practice for handling a failed resolve on a ui-route state? i love the concept of resolve but i can't get past the ability to handle errors like getting a promise directly from a service in the controller and being able to handle the failure/progress right from there,1
46584_irc_angularjs,robdubya,"themime well, you can either handle it there (inside teh resolve); but handling it means it resolves; alternately you can just leave it alone, and then catch the $stateChangeError event",2

46584_irc_angularjs,wafflej0ck,"themime: I setup a LoaderManager service to handle showing/hiding various loading directives that were associated with the loading events by name; that turned out being nice and flexible, then you can use the service to trigger changes to the loaders at the appropriate times and it'll basically work wherever since you can just inject the service into other stuff, plus gives you a central place to see what's going on with the loaders",0

46638_irc_angularjs,Grokling,"wiherek: My understanding is mostly don't use rootScope at all. Anything you think is a candidate for rootScopeness, is equally suited to being stored in a service (which again you can inject on demand, but isn't inherited by everything). Modularity = easy testing, and easy code portability.",0
46638_irc_angularjs,wiherek,especially with stuff that is used pretty much everywhere in the app; right; but then again there's this line from angularjs faq,0
46638_irc_angularjs,Grokling,"wiherek: You can cheat a little with services.. I have 11ty things that I needed to refer to, so I injected them all into one service, then inject that one service into wherever I needed to use them.",0
46638_irc_angularjs,wiherek,"yea, like a service registry; 'Conversely, don't create a service whose only purpose in life is to store and return bits of data.'; 'In particular, don't use it for code, only data. If you're tempted to put a function on $rootScope, it's almost always better to put it in a service that can be injected where it's needed, and more easily tested.'; that seems like a fair division",0
46638_irc_angularjs,Grokling,"Right, so you use a service to 'get' the data, and 'post' the data as well. application state is about the only thing I can think of for rootScope. Even user specifics get a service (because there are functions that you'd use there)",0
46638_irc_angularjs,wiherek,"Grokling, I have a user service; but I keep the current user profile in $rootScope; i only manipulate it through a service; but no, I don't use a service to get the data; that's not necessary I think, it's like a getter / setter for localStorage, when you can use plain JavaScript; shilon: please create a plunkr so we can relate",0
46638_irc_angularjs,Grokling,"I have a user service. I have nested states. My 'root' state loads the necessaries into $scope, and seeing as all subsequent states inherit that scope, the outcome is much the same, except I didn't mess with $rootScope.",0
46638_irc_angularjs,wiherek,"@Grokling that's right, as long as you use controllerAs or likewise; OR don't use primitives; otherwise they will get overwritten; only in the scope you access them from.",0
46638_irc_angularjs,Grokling,primitives are just a bad idea where $scope is concerned!,0
46638_irc_angularjs,wiherek,"I think it's ok as long as you use controllerAs; i haven't yet seen it working with ui-router, where there is no ng-controller directive",0
46638_irc_angularjs,Grokling,"Yeah, but then you've broken the mechanism where you alter the values via the service. Because you've static'd the values.",0
46638_irc_angularjs,wiherek,i didn't get that; :),0
46638_irc_angularjs,ingsoc,wiherek: I am sure controllerAs works with ui-router without ng-controller being used in the template,0
46638_irc_angularjs,Grokling,wiherek: Which part?,0
46638_irc_angularjs,wiherek,"they are object properties in fact; ingsoc, tx; Grokling, 'static\'d the values'",0
46638_irc_angularjs,Grokling,properties == primitives EXCEPT if they're objects or arrays in their own right.,0
46638_irc_angularjs,ingsoc,".state {; }; .controllerAs: 'Ctrl'; .controller: Controller,; i think",0
46638_irc_angularjs,Grokling,"var object = {property: 'something'}; $scope.value = object.property; will mean that $scope.value is a primitive, and later altering object will have no impact on $scope.value.",0
46638_irc_angularjs,wiherek,right; ingsoc: do you define controller in state in a global var?,0
46638_irc_angularjs,ingsoc,not sure what you mean; there is just a controller property of the object you pass to state function,0
46638_irc_angularjs,Grokling,wiherek: in a angular.module().config() block; The controller itself in a angular.module().controller() Is that what you meant?,0
46638_irc_angularjs,wiherek,I thought you meant controller: Controller &lt;- with that being a global var; you meant controller: 'SomeCtrl' right?,0
46638_irc_angularjs,ingsoc,i meant as a property of the parameter to ui-router $stateProvider.state; wiherek: where you talking to me ?,0
46638_irc_angularjs,wiherek,"yes; see, there was this discussion about binding a controller to a variable like that; controller: MyCtrl; where var MyCtrl = ['$scope', function ($scope) { etc...; nevermind ;)",0
46638_irc_angularjs,ingsoc,"myController($scope) {; controllerAs syntax essentially does this...; this.propertyA; this.propertyB; $scope.myCtrl = this; }; is that what you meant ?; i dunno, just guessing; the above is the same thing as doing ng-controller=""MyController as MyCtrl"" in a template",0

47277_irc_angularjs,mattblang,what is the proper way to break up my views into smaller units. I read in the docs that a new $scope is created for each ng include,1
47277_irc_angularjs,jaawerth,"mattblang: a child scope is created - it inherits from the parent scope though so you can still access the stuff; mattblang: a lot of directives create a child scope though (ng-repeat, for example, creates a separate child for each repeat); if you don't want it to happen, you can always write a custom directive for your partials and set it to NOT create a new scope with scope: false",2
47277_irc_angularjs,mattblang,"jaawerth yeah, I was reading though that it is bad practice to rely on parent scope, assumibly since it forces a DOM structure",0
47277_irc_angularjs,jaawerth,"mattblang: to a certain extent it's unavoidable, though. That said, I don't often use ng-include myself. I usually have a layout made up of partials encompassed in ui-views using ui-router; (in which you can specify both a template and controller in the route config); other partials will come from custom directives I've written, and once in a while I'll have some ng-includes in there; but by the time I've used ng-include, my templates have been broken up into enough discrete parts that I really don't have to worry about crazy scope inheritance stuff.",0

49496_irc_angularjs,Grokling,donCams: I can't do a filter inside the ng-model assignment though right?,0
49496_irc_angularjs,donCams,oh yeah... better parse in the controller,0
49496_irc_angularjs,Grokling,"donCams: Can't.. the thing object is generic, and often it shouldn't be an integer.",0
49496_irc_angularjs,donCams,so thing.value can be a string? but it's only bound to the input[number]; just parseInt(thing.value),0
49496_irc_angularjs,Grokling,"It's bound to a text, and textarea as well. parseInt is non-assignable.. I tried that already, and it makes perfect sense in a bidirectional binding.",0

49513_irc_angularjs,FarLight,"I have a service with a few functions in it, one of which is a $resource that needs to be loaded before any code in the controller is executed. Is there anyway to force it to get resolved without having my entire controller inside a callback?",1
49513_irc_angularjs,wafflej0ck,FarLight: you could use resolve: on your route definition,2
49513_irc_angularjs,FarLight,"wafflej0ck: Thank you for replying, that is what I am trying to do",0
49513_irc_angularjs,wafflej0ck,FarLight: personally I usually just do the setup in the controller though and have it wait for the promise on the service to be resolved if I need to delay it,0
49513_irc_angularjs,FarLight,Okay,0
49513_irc_angularjs,wafflej0ck,"but yeah with ui-router or ngRoute you should be able to define a resolve that stops it from returning right away, the problem with this is it delays the view change until the request completes, maybe that's what you want but I prefer to change the view and show loading messages on the view you're going to over delaying the change",0
49513_irc_angularjs,FarLight,Does it prevent the previous view from disappearing?,0
49513_irc_angularjs,wafflej0ck,yeah pretty sure it just sits there until the resolve is done; once the promises from the resolve are complete then it moves on to making the controller and loading the new view,0
49513_irc_angularjs,FarLight,Maybe the controller is preferable then.,0
49513_irc_angularjs,wafflej0ck,"FarLight: yeah just depends on how you're going to show ""loading""; FarLight: and how long that takes for your app",0

50316_irc_angularjs,davek,"So yeah, anyone have any cool tricks for combining a number of separate services into one simply for organizational purposes. I.e.

50316_irc_angularjs,ctanga,what does one of the services apis look like?,0
50316_irc_angularjs,davek,"ctanga, what do you mean? The actual restangular services are ludicrously simple generally, like one line that returns Restangular.service('resourceName') for the most part.",0
50316_irc_angularjs,Grokling,"davek, you 'could' inject all your services into an api-service? Or go all out with a recordContext pattern, and leave the factories separated..",0
50316_irc_angularjs,jaawerth,davek: are you still all into restmod?,0
50316_irc_angularjs,davek,"I'd simply have each model inject the API and register itself with it but the issue there is obviously that none of them would be registered unless they were injected at some point.; jaawerth, nah fuck that.",0
50316_irc_angularjs,jaawerth,lol; I thought you were all about it; back to restangular then? or hand-coded?,0
50316_irc_angularjs,ctanga,I guess Im fuzzy on the problem then,0
50316_irc_angularjs,davek,I was until the repo owner demonstrated his complete ignorance regarding promises.,0

50316_irc_angularjs,jaawerth,"davek, wafflej0ck: oh, I'm curious if you guys have run int othis and if I'm missing anything. Yesterday someone was asking about passing data between states, but without using state/url params; and not just for child states, so no inheritance; you could use some scope inheritance stuff, but I realized.. ui-router doesn't seem to have anything in place for doing essentially ""flash messages"" that only persist over a single state change (or let you easily directly pass data between states). I coded up a nifty little service for it but I""m wondering if I missed some built in ui-router functionality that handles this",0

50316_irc_angularjs,jaawerth,ctanga: that question for me?,0
50316_irc_angularjs,ctanga,jaawerth: yeah,0
50316_irc_angularjs,baweaver,can't say I blame them honestly.,0
50316_irc_angularjs,ctanga,like what kinda of data do you want to pass and in what cases?,0
50316_irc_angularjs,davek,"jaawerth, for flash messages I use a service.",0
50316_irc_angularjs,jaawerth,"yeah, I haven't run into this much because I usually just use services and let them handle the data sharing",0
50316_irc_angularjs,davek,Passing data between unrelated states should be done via services IMO in the same way that passing data between unrelated scopes should use services.,0
50316_irc_angularjs,jaawerth,BUT I could see potential situations where you might want/need to pass arbitrary data without wanting to create Yet Another Singleton,0
50316_irc_angularjs,Foxandxss,al passing data sounds better with services,0
50316_irc_angularjs,davek,"5 minute compilation times, a personal record!",0
50316_irc_angularjs,Foxandxss,"jaawerth: btw, managed to solve the nginx issue",0
50316_irc_angularjs,jaawerth,"anyway, I thought it was a neat thought experiment, so I coded what I think is a nifty service that passes data and then clears it upon $stateChangeSuccess, I'm just wondering if I'm solving a problem that doesn't need to be solved.; one sec, I'll post the plunk; note - this isn't MY use-case, it was someone asking a question in here",0
50316_irc_angularjs,ctanga,"davek: if theyre all that simple, why not just create a single API object that has all those restangular services?",0
50316_irc_angularjs,jaawerth,I think their use-case was something to do with a redirect and wanting to pass non-simple data without using params,0
50316_irc_angularjs,ctanga,ah,0
50316_irc_angularjs,jaawerth,"but as sort of a case-specific thing. This functionality exists in server-side MVCs (RoR, Dancer, Catalyst to name a few off the top of my head) so I thought it'd make sense to implement for ui-router",0
50316_irc_angularjs,davek,ctanga they're not all that simple some of them have some custom methods attached etc.,0

50316_irc_angularjs,davek,Providers can depend upon other providers yeah? Maybe I can implement each model as a provider and have it depend on the API provider? Then register the service (name?) with the API provider.,0
50316_irc_angularjs,ctanga,davek: sure why no; not,0
50316_irc_angularjs,jaawerth,davek: isn't what you're talking about a good use of constructor functions and object inheritance?; you could use providers for the constructors and instantiate them in a sort of master service,0
50316_irc_angularjs,ctanga,davek: IIRC providers wont get run unless theyre depended on; or maybe its just the $get portion,0
50316_irc_angularjs,jaawerth,that way you can have a master object for common methods and calls and inherit from them for your APIs that require specific methods,0
50316_irc_angularjs,Grokling,"davek: Heres something I've been playing with - I think there's some overlap with what you're thinking of. <a href=""http://plnkr.co/edit/KghXVJkE0gLL7IqYBvc0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://plnkr.co/edit/KghXVJkE0gLL7IqYBvc0</a>",0
50316_irc_angularjs,ctanga,jaawerth: heh Im reading this code and still dont get the point,0
50316_irc_angularjs,davek,"jaawerth, nah this is just organizational. The API service is just going to be an object that wraps all of my other services so I don't have to clutter my goddamn controller signatures with a bunch of dependencies.",0
50316_irc_angularjs,jaawerth,"ctanga: Well.. that's why I'm sharing it. It was a bit late and I was kind of just into the idea of implementing it but I'm thinking I was trying to solve a nonexistent problem.

50659_irc_angularjs,raidex,Hi all -- can anyone point out the way to trigger a refresh of a nested controller? Essentially I need to trigger a REST call to refresh a child controller when its parent is refreshed. Many thanks.,1
50659_irc_angularjs,wafflej0ck,raidex: you should likely be using a service or factory to wrap up the API calls and data returned from them and can manage the data refresh between the factories instead of trying to manage that in the controllers; raidex: alternatively you could use $scope.broadcast to send an event through the scopes to the children; but typically I think the factory/service option is better,2
50659_irc_angularjs,raidex,wafflej0ck: is that at all related to scope.$digest or scope.$apply?,0
50659_irc_angularjs,wafflej0ck,haha not getting too extremist are we zomg :),0
50659_irc_angularjs,zomg,lol,0
50659_irc_angularjs,wafflej0ck,raidex: not really the event broadcast/emit/on stuff is kind of it's own thing just an event bus for sending messages up or down the scopes and reacting to them; raidex: I typically don't like it because it feels loose regarding which thing triggered the event etc.,0

52560_irc_angularjs,wafflej0ck,farn5w0rth: well the problem is it's going to complain if it has to load angular multiple times I suppose if you use iframes you could do it and keep them isolated,0
52560_irc_angularjs,farn5w0rth,wafflej0ck: not sure how do use an iframe to load it...do you have an example,0
52560_irc_angularjs,wafflej0ck,farn5w0rth: I mean I want to smash 4 executables into one isn't really a use case for any framework I know of :) just google about iframe you'd basically just be loading the index.html from the angular app into your page,0
52560_irc_angularjs,farn5w0rth,wafflej0ck: ok yea i found some stuff thanks...and yea i hear you its a dumb exercise but i just need to show this shit works right now lol,0
52560_irc_angularjs,wafflej0ck,farn5w0rth: yup POCs are always a mess good luck :),0
52560_irc_angularjs,farn5w0rth,wafflej0ck: yeap. good learning exercise though,0
52560_irc_angularjs,wafflej0ck,farn5w0rth: yeah trial by fire,0

52720_irc_angularjs,Greed,"Hey guys, I have a pretty unique problem as far as I can tell; If I'm doing an ng-repeat=""item in items"" and I need to retrieve those items later, what is the best way to go about doing that?; I'm not sure if there's a way to iteratively apply ng-model=; But each of those items has a unique ID, and I need to tie those items to a JSON POST later",1
52720_irc_angularjs,narutimateum,Greed: var idx = $scope.client.list.indexOf($row);var data = $scope.client.list[idx];,2
52720_irc_angularjs,Greed,"How would I tie that into an ng-repeat?; indexOf was my first thought, but these are all dynamic; I'm pulling a random list of questions from a server, and each question has a unique ID; I'm using an ng-repeat to show those questions and turn them into form inputs once I have them; But I don't know how to track those values and send them back properly; I can't do ng-model=""data.{{questionID}}"" for example; I'm probably just going to end up serializing it with jQuery; And parsing it out",0
52720_irc_angularjs,Grokling,"Greed: your question isn't immediately clear. You have access to 'item' while inside your ng-repeat iteration, so someFunction(item.questionId) will work.; But perhaps that isn't what you're asking??; jQuery is almost never the answer ;-)",0
52847_irc_angularjs,chromatome,Helloo; Anyone know the best way to do something before a state is loaded using ui-router? I'm trying to check facebook login before the initial page loads so I can either load the loggedIn state or the loggedOut state.,1
52847_irc_angularjs,themime,chromatome: check out resolve,2
52847_irc_angularjs,chromatome,That's what I was thinking. Should I be making a service to use in there then? AuthService or something?,0
52847_irc_angularjs,themime,"chromatome: sounds like exactly what you want - also there are events, can't remeber their names but they correspond to a state loading, but based on your specific descript id say resolve; yes exactly; wrap the service call in a promise; and return that from the resolve",0
52847_irc_angularjs,chromatome,"Ah coolcoolcool. I'll take a look. I was trying to use the stateChange events yesterday, but it kept saying that there was no ""on"" method for $scope and $rootScope.",0
52847_irc_angularjs,themime,"that was my alternative suggestion but i haven't actually done anything with those and they seem more global really, and this sounds specific to a page or area. you can use a parent state with the auth i bet to prevent them from accessing sub states",0
52847_irc_angularjs,robdubya,resovle + promise &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;> events,0
52847_irc_angularjs,themime,^,0
52847_irc_angularjs,chromatome,Ah kk. Thanks! I'll try that out. Using the state change events might work too but I feel like that will be heavier if it has to check the login state with facebook on every state change.,0

52847_irc_angularjs,scythe__,"ahh yeah robdubya my problem is that it's constantly stopping to look and search how to do something, finding 30 tutorials with crappy spaghetti code which doesn't even work",0
52847_irc_angularjs,sekyms,"scythe__: for me it's finding old tutorials; scythe__: the code school one is really good, but it doesn't delve very deep",0
52847_irc_angularjs,scythe__,ahh yeah codeschool is a great resource I wish they had more videos,0
52847_irc_angularjs,sekyms,scythe__: it's a good start; i personally hate the angularjs.com one. the phone one,0
52847_irc_angularjs,scythe__,?,0
52847_irc_angularjs,sekyms,on angularjs.com there is a tutorial that deals with android phones; i just cant work through it for some reason,0
52847_irc_angularjs,scythe__,"oh gotcha hmm, have you had success developing angular for mobile?",0
52847_irc_angularjs,sekyms,"scythe__: haven't got that far; with cors it always sends options first; its the way it works; I have this link; a href=""#/user/{{issue.user.id}}""&gt;{{issue.user.login}}&lt;/a>; that should trigger .when('/user', {; correct?",0
52847_irc_angularjs,wafflej0ck,sekyms: you'd want .when('/user/:userId',0
52847_irc_angularjs,sekyms,wafflej0ck: aha; didnt know i needed that; wafflej0ck: you sire are a gentleman and a scholar,0
52847_irc_angularjs,wafflej0ck,sekyms: it makes it so you can read $routeParams.userId in the controller by injecting $routeParams... after you're feeling a bit more comfortable with angular would check out ui-router too it's kind of the defacto router for more complex stuff; sekyms: heh wouldn't go that far but they gave me a piece of paper eventually :),0
52847_irc_angularjs,sekyms,$routeParams as a dependency?,0
52847_irc_angularjs,wafflej0ck,what ego? :D; sekyms: yeah it can be injected into the controller alongside $scope,0
52847_irc_angularjs,sekyms,what is the advantage of doing that versus using $location to get it?,0
52847_irc_angularjs,wafflej0ck,sekyms: mostly just having everything clearly defined and a bit easier to access,0
52847_irc_angularjs,sekyms,so is it bad that I'm nit using $scope; the code school tutorials never even mention it,0
52847_irc_angularjs,wafflej0ck,sekyms: no if you're using the controller as syntax that's all good,0
52847_irc_angularjs,sekyms,wafflej0ck: are you a contributor to angular?,0
52847_irc_angularjs,wafflej0ck,"sekyms: not aside from the IRC... just a user/developer; sekyms: but in here a lot and talk with some of the contributors on projects regularly... haven't submitted any pull requests though; I generally try to help ramp people up or help them get over bumps here and learn stuff along the way but regularly just freelance and do various contract work and whatnot, but been using Angular on pretty much a daily basis for just over a year now I think",0
52847_irc_angularjs,sekyms,that gives me some hope; wafflej0ck: I keep telling myself I just need to dive into the right situation and use it 8 hours a day for a couple of weeks and I'll be fine,0
52847_irc_angularjs,themime,"sekyms: thats what i did, i feel pretty comfortable with it now. i feel like i can answer a lot of questions here fairly easily; always learning though",0
52847_irc_angularjs,wafflej0ck,"sekyms: yeah just need to start working on some random projects that will force you to learn, 8 hours a day would be great but I find I have less time than that in most cases (delirious after 2am)",0
52847_irc_angularjs,sekyms,either that wafflej0ck or find a place with a mentor,0
52847_irc_angularjs,wafflej0ck,"sekyms: yeah there are sites for getting direct chat time with a mentor, haven't tried, but might be worth it",0
52847_irc_angularjs,sekyms,wafflej0ck: any ideas which?,0
52847_irc_angularjs,wafflej0ck,"sekyms: I read about half way through one angular book around version 1.0.7 and the book was at least half out dated information so I just got the general gist of what the parts were but had no idea about the actual syntax still, didn't do the tutorial on the site but did watch this video till it sank in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhfUv0spHCY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhfUv0spHCY</a> also there is a huge list of resources here <a href=""https://github."" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://github.</a>; com/jmcunningham/AngularJS-Learning",0

52847_irc_angularjs,sekyms,dated stuff is the biggest problem,0
52847_irc_angularjs,wafflej0ck,yeah it's rough when things are changing a lot; typically good to rely on the docs for the particular version you're using; at least for confirmation of suspicions,0
52847_irc_angularjs,sekyms,knowing which version to use can be a struggle,0
52847_irc_angularjs,wafflej0ck,"yeah it's a weird spot right now... basically should be going with 1.3 but most of the tutorials/posts are going to be relating to 1.2 there isn't a huge departure though so most of it should still apply the same; the use of the ""as"" keyword is more prevelant I think in 1.3 but overall things like providers (service/factories/values/constants) and directives are still pretty much the same; maybe some small fixes/changes",0
52847_irc_angularjs,sekyms,thanks for all the info,0
52847_irc_angularjs,wafflej0ck,sure,0

52962_irc_angularjs,thomastuts,is there an easy way to add properties to an isolate scope of an existing directive? i'm trying to extend angular-ui-bootstrap's datepicker directive with an extra function on the scope but it's not working; i'm using $provide.decorator to add it to the directive's scope definition; but it doesn't seem to be doing anything,1

54259_irc_angularjs,wafflej0ck,nairys: just asking cause ui-grid I believe is a more active project and ngGrid I believe was mostly left behind by the original team who developed it (haven't looked recently though),2
54259_irc_angularjs,nairys,my boss won't let me switch to ui-grid; doesn't want stuff in beta in our production code,0

54259_irc_angularjs,jr3,I'm still confused on the whole bower dependency thing,0

54259_irc_angularjs,BahamutWC,"jr3: update bower.json's version of angular, and just run bower update angular",0
54259_irc_angularjs,jr3,"bower? a package manager, I tend to break it a lot; somehow",0
54259_irc_angularjs,nairys,bower's pretty nifty,0
54259_irc_angularjs,wafflej0ck,yeah just need to get familiar with your bower.json file,0
54259_irc_angularjs,BahamutWC,bower is very useful now that it's more stable; it used to be very broken a year ago,0
54259_irc_angularjs,wafflej0ck,yeah I'm really liking it I didn't use it more than a year ago though,0
54259_irc_angularjs,nairys,can't imagine life without bower &amp; grunt,0
54259_irc_angularjs,BahamutWC,I use gulp more now than grunt,0
54259_irc_angularjs,jr3,like I expect bower install to add the js into my index.html,0
54259_irc_angularjs,nairys,i wouldn't mind trying gulp sometime,0
54259_irc_angularjs,BahamutWC,gulp has some curve too if you're not comfortable with node.js &amp; streams though,0
54259_irc_angularjs,jr3,am I wrong on that?,0
54259_irc_angularjs,wafflej0ck,jr3: wiredep does that for you it's a grunt task,0

54259_irc_angularjs,jr3,ah,0
54259_irc_angularjs,wafflej0ck,yeah I haven't used it in the past; I recently started playing with it; but not super thrilled,0
54259_irc_angularjs,BahamutWC,I've had to use it because thebigredgeek is a big fan of it heh,0
54259_irc_angularjs,jr3,and aren't you supposed to keep all packages aligned with the angular version?,0
54259_irc_angularjs,BahamutWC,jr3: just the official angular ones,0
54259_irc_angularjs,wafflej0ck,the SublimeText sidebar for copy file as Tag Script or Style and just paste and I'm all good,0

54259_irc_angularjs,jr3,"i just need to sit down and really get to know it; like if I bower install uigrid, that should go under devdependencies in my bower.json, right?",0
54259_irc_angularjs,wafflej0ck,"jr3: yeah it's probably not as complicated as you're thinking, there's just the semver stuff you gotta sorta understand and then it just uses that info from the bower.json in things you bower install to figure out what to actually install into the bower_components folder",0
54259_irc_angularjs,jr3,sorry i mean dependecies,0
54259_irc_angularjs,wafflej0ck,jr3: if you do --save it goes into the regular dependencies which means you need it to use that project (if you're making a module); if you do --dev-dependencies it means a developer needs that during development of the module but it's not needed for something that's using the module; er rather --save-dev,0
54259_irc_angularjs,jr3,ahh gotcha,0
54259_irc_angularjs,BahamutWC,an example of a dev dependency is angular-mocks,0
54259_irc_angularjs,wafflej0ck,right test stuffs,0
54259_irc_angularjs,jr3,testing stuff,0
54259_irc_angularjs,BahamutWC,npm operates very similarly,0
54259_irc_angularjs,Grimm_,"wafflej0ck: Got it, thanks! Something simple and stupid that I overlooked for over an hour, as usual!",0
54259_irc_angularjs,wafflej0ck,"yeah it's just up to whoever writes the bower.json for a module to specify what gets ignored when someone installs it and where the main files are, if they don't do that you get a mess",0
54259_irc_angularjs,BahamutWC,Grimm_: the story of every software engineer's life :),0
54259_irc_angularjs,wafflej0ck,Grimm_: cool yeah is a thorn for sure,0
54259_irc_angularjs,Grimm_,"BahamutWC: Haha, yep!",0
54259_irc_angularjs,wafflej0ck,Grimm_: you have things on different ports or different domains or actually have to enable CORS server side?,0
54259_irc_angularjs,stormbytes,wafflej0ck back to that preloading data example you posted just before &amp; promises... is there some special way to trigger getData() ? or do I simply call getData() from every method in the api?,0
54259_irc_angularjs,wafflej0ck,there were tears there were laughs,0
54259_irc_angularjs,nairys,mostly tears,0
54259_irc_angularjs,wafflej0ck,"stormbytes: you can call like, service.getData(); return service;",0
54259_irc_angularjs,nairys,i think i finally got everything working a couple hours ago,0
54259_irc_angularjs,stormbytes,"point is, the service is supposed to operate on the data, so the exposed api methods are processing the data in different ways. It wouldn't be clean to have the controller call the 'init' routine on an external service. I need to rig it to do that internally.. just wondering on what the best way would be",0
54259_irc_angularjs,wafflej0ck,stormbytes: would be good if you can throw together a sample plunkr so I can see what you're doing so far and what you want to do; stormbytes: you can just put some data in a someData.json file in there and load it up with $http.get in the service to build out the example,0
54259_irc_angularjs,stormbytes,wafflej0ck i don't have much yet :) essentially the service (1) gets a yaml file (2) convers it to json and (3) exposes different parts of the json object on its methods,0
54259_irc_angularjs,wafflej0ck,stormbytes: yeah would just be good to see what you're doing so far so I can understand where you're at with it and what you should change or how you could do things to get it to do what you want in a more general sense,0
54259_irc_angularjs,stormbytes,"so say the yaml file is a booklist.yml, you'd have service.getBookList(), service.getUniqueAuthors(), etc",0
54259_irc_angularjs,wafflej0ck,just need 1 sample don't have to recreate a set of endpoints if it works 1 time it works everywhere but use the plunkr link in the IRC and throw a sample of your code in there,0
54259_irc_angularjs,stormbytes,i don't think the controller should be responsible to call service.loadBooksFile(),0
54259_irc_angularjs,wafflej0ck,nope I agree,0
54259_irc_angularjs,stormbytes,"ok, will do",0
54259_irc_angularjs,wafflej0ck,I'm saying before you return service; you can do service.getData(); so the controller doesn't have to call it; the controller just has to have the service injected into it,0
54259_irc_angularjs,stormbytes,"yes, i know that part... (dependency injection) but wouldn't service.getData() have to be called from the ""bottom"" of each and every method? (funtion)",0
54259_irc_angularjs,wafflej0ck,what I called var service; in the SO post and here could be called whatever you want as well (naming it service may have confused matters it's not a special name just defining an object and then returning it); stormbytes: nope; stormbytes: the call in the one place is good enough because that is just one instance of that object that gets injected anywhere it gets used,0
54259_irc_angularjs,stormbytes,no i get what i meant with 'service'; let me put together a plunk... ;),0
54259_irc_angularjs,wafflej0ck,so it just gets called within the service definition and never needs to be called anywhere else really; yeah cool,0
54259_irc_angularjs,stormbytes,"wafflej0ck; <a href=""http://plnkr.co/edit/uSZ9rI0L2ohLd1lpBycs?p=preview"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://plnkr.co/edit/uSZ9rI0L2ohLd1lpBycs?p=preview</a>",0
54259_irc_angularjs,BahamutWC,"stormbytes: use the $http service, not $.get",0
54259_irc_angularjs,stormbytes,yeah been meaning to switch to that.. point is really about initBooks(),0
54259_irc_angularjs,BahamutWC,"something like this <a href=""http://plnkr.co/edit/BLJ00vo2VgCB3IwaWw11?p=preview"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://plnkr.co/edit/BLJ00vo2VgCB3IwaWw11?p=preview</a> stormbytes",0
54259_irc_angularjs,stormbytes,"well kinda but... i want to keep the service processes encapsulated. controllers should just call methods --- thats essentially what i was asking, how to go about it so the initBooks() is triggered automatically",0
54259_irc_angularjs,BahamutWC,"stormbytes: sure; if you want to trigger initBooks automatically, you might want to look into resolves with something like ui-router",0
54259_irc_angularjs,stormbytes,what are resolves?; seems like a seriously overcomplicated way of running a basic 'constructor' function,0
54259_irc_angularjs,BahamutWC,"well, you could run it synchronously in the controller like I have in my example; that would run it automatically...not sure what you really want",0
54259_irc_angularjs,stormbytes,i don't want to run the $http call from within the controller; i want the controller to call Books.method() and have the service automatically make sure the source file was already loaded,0
54259_irc_angularjs,BahamutWC,"you essentially have to though - even if it's in a service, it's still have something has to be run",0
54259_irc_angularjs,stormbytes,which is why i wanted to put Books.initBooks() in module.run() you get it?,0
54259_irc_angularjs,BahamutWC,"you could do that, but you're not guaranteed it will finish before the controller instantiates; it's the wrong way to do something like that; that is due to the async nature",0
54259_irc_angularjs,stormbytes,still it makes no sense to have the controller operating the internals of a service (eg.. calling BooksInit() from within the controler); doesn't seem like a clean way of doing it,0
54259_irc_angularjs,BahamutWC,it's fine - the controller is the link between the model and the view; the models often have to come from the server; that is the purpose of a controller (and services to help keep controllers clean),0
54259_irc_angularjs,stormbytes,yeah but that controller should not work the internals of a service.. least i don't thin kso; the controller should simply call service.method(),0
54259_irc_angularjs,BahamutWC,"well, I think you'll find most software engineers would disagree with you *shrug*; then design your methods so you can just do that",0
54259_irc_angularjs,stormbytes,precisely my question - how,0
54259_irc_angularjs,BahamutWC,"done: <a href=""http://plnkr.co/edit/BLJ00vo2VgCB3IwaWw11?p=preview"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://plnkr.co/edit/BLJ00vo2VgCB3IwaWw11?p=preview</a>; all I did is move one .then block - it's exactly the same as before though otherwise",0
54259_irc_angularjs,stormbytes,i don't think you understand what i'm trying to do; initBooks() should *not* be exposed.,0
54259_irc_angularjs,BahamutWC,"I do, I think you just don't understand the ramifications of your claimed position",0
54259_irc_angularjs,stormbytes,it should be *internal* to the service == its a private method.,0
54259_irc_angularjs,BahamutWC,"you won't be able to do any sort of XHR if you don't do something like that; then make it private...; and if I don't understand what you're trying to do, explain yourself clearly; I cannot give good help if you don't help someone understand what you're trying to do :/",0
54259_irc_angularjs,stormbytes,"ok, sure... here goes:; the Books service should retrieve the books yaml/xml/whatever file on its own, without the controllers knowing how that works or that its even a part of the process.; the books 'source' file is entirely internal to Books",0
54259_irc_angularjs,BahamutWC,so that call is async,0
54259_irc_angularjs,stormbytes,"when a controller requests Books.getBookList() the Book service shoudl automatically check to see if books.xml has already been loaded; now.. i know hwo to do that, but that would mean calling initBooks() in each and every api method; which seems ass backwards...but hey, this *is* javascript right :)",0
54259_irc_angularjs,BahamutWC,"stormbytes: if you want to keep it private, that would be the only way to do that; but, you can cache the request",0
54259_irc_angularjs,stormbytes,"ok, well that's the answer then. what do you mean by caching the request?",0
54259_irc_angularjs,BahamutWC,"$http.get('path/to/books', { cache: true }) will only make one XHR request and any future call to that will return the cached data",0
54259_irc_angularjs,stormbytes,browser cache?; what if the data changes?,0
54259_irc_angularjs,BahamutWC,"just in memory; if you don't want to cache it, then you can just omit that object",0
54259_irc_angularjs,stormbytes,"or is this only until a page-refresh?; no-no that's actually great, i'm just wondering how to refresh the data if the file changes at the source?",0
54259_irc_angularjs,BahamutWC,"you'd have to send a server notification and maybe mess with <a href=""https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/%24cacheFactory"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$cacheFactory</a>; whether that's via polling, websockets, SSE, or whatever, that's up to you to decide",0
54259_irc_angularjs,stormbytes,i'll play with it both ways and see what i get ;); thanks for the tip,0
54259_irc_angularjs,BahamutWC,np,0
54259_irc_angularjs,wafflej0ck,"stormbytes: sorry had to get some food and got pulled away here's an updated plunkr too <a href=""http://plnkr.co/edit/XayvS36VooyQvuWMPuRX?p=preview"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://plnkr.co/edit/XayvS36VooyQvuWMPuRX?p=preview</a>; stormbytes: if you want to keep books from being directly exposed you could I just threw it in there cause I usually do expose the data from the service directly just to make things easier",0
54259_irc_angularjs,BahamutWC,I prefer to have model services -&gt; services to format data for presentation -> controllers consume data; and the reverse direction for submission of data back to the server,0
54259_irc_angularjs,wafflej0ck,"yeah I typically have something similar, sometimes use a factory to create instances from the results in the service or sometimes it's a bit simpler than that depending on the scenario",0
54259_irc_angularjs,BahamutWC,"yeah, of course it's not necessarily rigid",0
54259_irc_angularjs,stormbytes,i'm amazed this simple task of executing an init() function is so complicated... wow,0
54259_irc_angularjs,BahamutWC,it's only as complicated as how much you want to abstract things,0
54259_irc_angularjs,wafflej0ck,"yeah; just abstracting things is beneficial most of the time; basically at the onset learning angular and doing things the right way does take more mental work but the actual amount of code you end up writing/testing/maintaining is way less than if you try to do it without some sort of MVC framework (unless you roll your own data bindinding, event bus, formatters, parsers, AJAX abstraction, promises etc., which works fine if you don't plan to work with the rest of the world and have a ton; of time on your hands)",0
54259_irc_angularjs,BahamutWC,it's also a lot cleaner,0

55766_irc_angularjs,andern,i'm not completely sure what you mean by 'based on the object id',0
55766_irc_angularjs,juristr,andern: Well often (other JS frameworks) there's some logic that you can always call .save on some instance of an object and internally based on whether it is a new entity (.id is not defined or &lt; 0) it executes a POST and otherwise a PUT request to the server (as normally done with REST apis); andern: It's not really that important as you can easily implement it by yourself...was just curious,0
55766_irc_angularjs,andern,i'm not exactly sure. we have implemented that on the client side here on the one place where we needed it; but it would be handy. sometimes it can be too much magic though :),0

58831_irc_angularjs,angelazou,"themime: yeah, but the thing is the element I want to access may not be available when the directive finished loading; like the form, since everything in angular is loaded &amp; rendered asynchronously; that would mean that I need to notify the directive when the form loading is completed, which adds an extra layer of complexity, which is not a good idea for me",0
58831_irc_angularjs,themime,"why won't the form be there?; unless you have some funky stuff going on, youll have access to the form elements from the directive - if code is running in the scope the html is at the very least pre-rendered in the background to the point you can manipulate them; im not sure on the exact cycle but now i may have to dig about; hmm i may be wrong angelazou <a href=""http://blog.brunoscopelliti.com/run-a-directive-after-the-dom-has-finished-rendering"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://blog.brunoscopelliti.com/run-a-directive-after-the-dom-has-finished-rendering</a>; but that link has a solution; however 1.3 fixed a lot of silly stuff like that sooo it may be a non issue",0
58831_irc_angularjs,angelazou,"yeah, before that, I had a hack where I created a directive with a very low priority so it would only execute stuff after the element finished rendering",0
58831_irc_angularjs,themime,"i don't ever do stuff with forms, i mean i use inputs obviously just never found a need for the level some people here do. mind what i ask youre working on?",0
58831_irc_angularjs,Grokling,themime: Do you know how to make radio buttons work?,0
58831_irc_angularjs,themime,"just curious what would require such a level of checking of fields, beyond the awesome default angular databinding and such; Grokling: yes, why?",0

58831_irc_angularjs,themime,"angelazou: ooh that makes sense. seems like a common issue, i wonder if someone else has done something similar like a plugin or something. angular is good like that; Grokling: yea i don't see any name="""" at all. also if you plunker it ill get it working if you can't figure it out. im not sure why having no name="""" would only let you check the first one though",0
58831_irc_angularjs,angelazou,"themime: yeah, I'd like to find one too if one's available, but this sort of implementation is usually tightly coupled with the existing code (e.g. the prompt on locationchange, $pristine check, etc.)",0

59944_irc_angularjs,smola1022,"in this case, there is a directive which has another directive nested inside of it in the template; in the js, the second directive requires the controller of the first directive; in the link function for the parent directive, it sends the element arg through to a method on the controller; inside this method, it does: self.$queryInput = element.find('input');; with or without jquery, when i pause with debugger, that call turns up an empty array because the input element it is looking for is in the template of the nested directive; i thought that nested directives all compile before any linking functions run, but it seems that the requirement of the parent controller is changing that flow; wow. ok, well, later on, a .focus() call is executed on that self.$queryInput property. with jquery, the call succeeds. without, it errors because the value is just an empty array; does jquery support some sort of late binding mechanism that allows for that property to get populated once the nested directive is compiled?",0

60287_irc_angularjs,Lewix,"hi; i need sound advice on architecturing our angularjs app better.

My question is what are the pros/cons and what would you suggest?; I was thinking about starting to use ui-router but I'm not sure if it's going to help much to be honest. I'm still blurry on the real use case of ui-router beside nested routes. Instead of nested routes we have isolated components; Also I decided to put most of the logic in the services/model",1

60287_irc_angularjs,BahamutWC,"Lewix: auth is the most common use case; but also if you want to ensure a certain flow through your app, then state change intercepting is vital (unless you want a bunch of that code injected into controllers and run on controller instantiation, which is fragile)",2

62317_irc_angularjs,BobbieBarker,youngnico: you can tap into ngMOdel via a directive; i'm assuming this is on an input field that you're using ng-validations on,2
62317_irc_angularjs,youngnico,yep,0
62317_irc_angularjs,BobbieBarker,with out completely understanding your use case; you'd need to write a directive then use $parser and $formatter on the ngModel object itself,0
62317_irc_angularjs,youngnico,"if the validation (minlength lets say) fails it will *not* update the actual object that the ng-model is pointed at; it keeps a separate copy until it's valid, then sets the new properties on the original object",0
62317_irc_angularjs,BobbieBarker,not necessarily sure what you are hoping to accomplish though or why you don't like the native behaviour on ngModel,0
62317_irc_angularjs,youngnico,To clarify context: I'd like to allow the model to be updated live (so it shows up anywhere else the data is bound) *even* if it's invalid.,0
62317_irc_angularjs,BobbieBarker,"Seems like you'd be introducing a swarm of problems down the line though by doing that; if it's invalid in that input field i would assume it's invalid for a reason and the user needs to correct that problem; if you bypass the validation and allow it to show up else where, *i.e where the user is expecting it to show up* and it shows up there the user may never realize that the value is invalid; i'd say that's horrible UI/UX",0
62317_irc_angularjs,youngnico,"BobbieBarker agreed - this is a fairly large content editing system, where we are not forcing data to be valid (on the client) in order to be saved.; We would like to leverage Angular's built in validation classes to indicate what will be validated later though (instead of re-writing all that as a new directive)",0
62317_irc_angularjs,BobbieBarker,youngnico what i would do then is instead of using actual validations I would write a directive that evaluates the model value and proviides UI feed back on the error; i wouldn't jump through the hoops of bypassing/breaking ng-validations,0
62317_irc_angularjs,youngnico,BobbieBarker: this would mean rewriting all validation / ng-class adds as well as ng-messages though =/; Though i totally agree with you in not changing core validations,0
62317_irc_angularjs,BobbieBarker,no...; so you'd just quit using ng-minlengh and have a mycomp-minlength directive you could write it to still activate your ng-messages; doing some simple directives like that shouldn't take more than 5-10 min apiece,0
62317_irc_angularjs,youngnico,"BobbieBarker: gotcha, so if i were to write that directive, are you suggesting marking the field as valid or not?",0
62317_irc_angularjs,BobbieBarker,"no i wouldn't tap into the validations and make the form invalid at all; since you said you're not concerned if the user saves invalid data; you're not realllly concerned with ""validating"" data at all, you just want to provide feed back if they are doing something stupid.; that's how i understood what you said; apologies if i misunderstood",0
62317_irc_angularjs,youngnico,"BobbieBarker: gotcha - you're tracking correctly ... so you're suggestion would be to use a separate validation-like directive that marks a ""is this thing cool or not"" flag/class/whatever?",0
62317_irc_angularjs,BobbieBarker,yeah,0

63602_irc_angularjs,aarobc,"moogey: yeah. one of the other devs at work suggested we try it out on a personal project to see if it's suitable for a big project coming up. He doesn't know it either, and man, studying this shit has been rough.",0

63602_irc_angularjs,aarobc,Why iframe?,0
63602_irc_angularjs,here4thegear,aarobc: because the developers who developed the plugin chose to do so.,0
63602_irc_angularjs,aarobc,fair enough,0
63602_irc_angularjs,here4thegear,"aarobc: I think largely because it is heavily styled and the only way to ensure that it stay that way was iframe.

63602_irc_angularjs,aarobc,"jaawerth: okay, trying to do something very simple: two drop downs, after you select one, angular does it's fancy magic and somehow the other controller of the other dropdown is populated from the results of a json request based on the value of the initial selection.; easy peasy in jquery, confusing and convoluted as hell in angular",0
63602_irc_angularjs,jaawerth,"haha well, angular is at its best when you're doing everything in a modular fashion - best to pull the disparate elements of this apart; the ng-options syntax is one of those things that's bizarrely opaque. what will the downloaded data look like?; array of strings? array of objects? object of objects?",0

63602_irc_angularjs,jaawerth,"damnit robdubya, I was just writing one; ;-)",0
63602_irc_angularjs,aarobc,"robdubya: yeah, is neat, but the confusing part is making that data do something after you get it. Do you send it off to another controller? do you use one controller to control both the selects?",0
63602_irc_angularjs,robdubya,oh - didnt see the 2nd bit. sec,0
63602_irc_angularjs,aarobc,actually this might work,0
63602_irc_angularjs,jaawerth,"aarobc: So, for heavy processing you might call functions in a factory or service (makes your code more testable and maintainable if more stuff is abstracted), but you still pull the strings from the controller. Have you used promises before?",0
63602_irc_angularjs,aarobc,no...,0
63602_irc_angularjs,moogey,promises are both amazing and kick you in the nuts suck,0
63602_irc_angularjs,aarobc,I started messing with this last weekend,0
63602_irc_angularjs,jaawerth,"no, they're just amazing; :P",0
63602_irc_angularjs,aarobc,and have managed to populate exactly two little array thingys; tables,0

63602_irc_angularjs,jaawerth,"well, promises are a concept that exists separate to angular. it's basically just a way let you do callbacks without running into nested callback hell - you can also chain them, so you can easily control async flow; doSomethingAsyncThatReturnsAPromise.then(function(result) { doSomethingWithResult; return someData; }).then(function(result) { // result here is now someData })",0
63602_irc_angularjs,robdubya,"aarobc so its just databinding - fetch the foo, set it on scope, make your 2nd dropdown reference it",0
63602_irc_angularjs,aarobc,robdubya: this is hurting my brain. attempting to figure it out,0
63602_irc_angularjs,robdubya,"aarobc its a lot easier to grok without the http stuff; <a href=""http://plnkr.co/edit/2qdOkTLJaSvMf2xet30L?p=preview"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://plnkr.co/edit/2qdOkTLJaSvMf2xet30L?p=preview</a>",0

63602_irc_angularjs,zomg,caolan/async is my go-to thing; easy and quick to integrate because everything is a callback; but seems Asynquence might also be a good choice since it has quite easy integration with node-style callbacks with its promise-things,0

11973_irc_c++-general,LBV_User,"idk flatbuffers, but msgpack seems more easy to handle",0
11973_irc_c++-general,mcerb,it kind of is,0
11973_irc_c++-general,rpav,msgpack heh; nlohmann/json ftw .. write cbor,0
11973_irc_c++-general,LBV_User,rpav: eventually you want a smaller representation than json,0
11973_irc_c++-general,rpav,"then stuff like ""how do i load a std::map&lt;std::string, MyType> from json"" is ""did you implement void from_json(const json&amp;, MyType&amp;)""; LBV_User: again, cbor",0
11973_irc_c++-general,LBV_User,"oh, didn't knew about it",0
11973_irc_c++-general,rpav,"you basically just ""j.to_cbor()"" and you get out something ~50% the size of compact (i.e. no whitespace) json; i do this and have a FileReader thing which uses PhysFS, and if you look for a .json it also looks for .cb .. pretty damn handy, makes modding simple",0
11973_irc_c++-general,kalven,flatbuffers and json/cbor/msgpack have different design goals,0
11973_irc_c++-general,rpav,"probably, flatbuffers sounds like ""i want to read large amounts of fixed-format data,"" but i don't know; but if i just want to read or send data for the most part that doesn't need to be super low latency or isn't like, streaming video, i'd just use json/etc",0
11973_irc_c++-general,kalven,the point of flatbuffers (and cap'n proto) is that there's no deserialization step,0
11973_irc_c++-general,rpav,"yeah, so adding a step where you need to transform the data sounds like ""using the wrong thing""",0

11973_irc_c++-general,kalven,I don't know if it includes a framing format,0
11973_irc_c++-general,rpav,"that seems mostly irrelevant, you almost certainly want that at the protocol level; like, what if you have out of order or parallel delivery or something and need to reconstruct",0
11973_irc_c++-general,LBV_User,"msgpack as an ""unpacker"" you can feed with pieces of data, and when an object is complete, it lets you pop out",0
11973_irc_c++-general,rpav,"with everything else msgpack fails to do, not really a reason i'd use it :P; write a simple container header and you know when you're done without having to try or retain state",0
11973_irc_c++-general,LBV_User,I see it is not the sharpest of the tools,0
11973_irc_c++-general,kalven,"don't get your layers mixed up, LBV_User :)",0
11973_irc_c++-general,LBV_User,"kalven: msgpack will not be part of the protocol as soon as I add TLS to it; but, to be honest, msgpack was so handy to make a simple protocol...",0
11973_irc_c++-general,rpav,"so do all the things like flatbuffers just assume everyone's little-endian and ieee754 or what; i feel like if they do nothing there, what's the point, but if they do, then that's not really decode-free; i dunno",0
11973_irc_c++-general,kalven,"there may be decoding, but it's random access without a deserialization step.",0
11973_irc_c++-general,rpav,ah,0
11973_irc_c++-general,LBV_User,"now, thinking more about it, I don't have much of a mix in my layers: asio handles the networking part, msgpack handles the protocol, the client session handles the first level and then a plugin handles the remaining of the request",0
11973_irc_c++-general,rpav,that's sortof missing a layer .. or does asio let you make message bundles or whatnot; or msgpack is sortof doing 2 things; i'd play around with asio if i had time for anything heh,0
11973_irc_c++-general,LBV_User,"we can say msgpack does the 2 things, the framing and the message format",0

11973_irc_c++-general,LBV_User,couldn't do what I wanted with it; and it adds some good bloat in that framing thing,0
11973_irc_c++-general,rpav,really? i thought it was pretty minimal but i haven't seen it in awhile,0
11973_irc_c++-general,LBV_User,"it even adds what kind of socket created the message; and it is not clear if yuo are receiving messages from this or from that connection, so you kinda need to add a ""session token"" yourself; also, on the REQ/REP you can't make the server answer more the once per REQ, so if you are transfering bigger data you need to keep ""pinging"" the server for the next piece",0

13916_irc_c++-general,Filousov,"Hi; Anyone very knowledgeable about threading?; How does this work? Like 370 people and noone writes anything into global chat?; Ok. I have a cache class which caches 1M+ entries - internally read/write locked with single RW mutex. Each access to some member either locks mutex for read/write. However when I'm sure the cache is already there, I'd like to single read lock it and then use methods without actually locking it for each call. What's the best way to do it?; E.g. switch from internal locking to external read locking; That also means once externally read locked, internal locks should never be even called.; The aim of this is to unblock parallel performance of the cache as it proves that too many lock happens and its main bottleneck.",1
13916_irc_c++-general,kalven,"Filousov: have you considered something like map&lt;key, shared_ptr&lt;const value&gt;> ?",2
13916_irc_c++-general,Filousov,"That I'm afraid would be extra slow; Just because too many memory allocations to even create the cache entries.; To add more detail - the cache is used for storing calculated volumes of 3D polyhedrons; The domain size is known; The cache uses 2 arrays - first of whole domain size and the second with cached values.; If the entry is not yet in cache. The domain size array has -1 in it's place.; Otherwise the integer pointing to the other array.; When the entry is not in cache and asked about it. it calculates it, write locks the cache and stores new 3D volume for element.; There are also specialized methods which are able to do this calculation in parallel for many requested 3D volumes at once - aka ensure 3D volumes are in cache.; At the moment they cannot.; But at the application start they are all uncomputed.; And there is a good reason to defer computation of them to later time.; Both due to computation and memory resources it takes to do the computation.; Surely no notification.; But the cache still needs to be read locked for any read access to it; And that's what's the problem when parallel algorithms on multiple threads starts using already present values in the cache; It's just fetching single volume from cache and it each locks; And the locking becomes bottleneck as the state of lock must be propagated between multiple processor caches; It actually is as fast to read values on single thread as to read them on 10+ threads; Due to locking overhead; Yes, maybe you are right.; Any thread can produce cached value.; That's what I'm doing; That's why I'm using RW lock; But that doesn't solve the issue; Since even read locking on N threads is too costly per method call; Yeah, finer-grained locking I was also thinking about; I was also thinking about std::atomic_bool to mark that I read lock it externally and disable internal locking methods by testing this bool; Of the cache - e.g. getVolume(int entryPos); Needs to internally read lock; There still are; getVolume() - checks that volume is here (read lock) - if yes, returns, otherwise computes + write locks it here; You need to read lock it; Since otherwise those checks that volume is here could be race conditioning writes to the cache; Yes, that looks as one solutions.; Maybe I could actually switch a domain size array to std::atomic_int; That way I could set the index to the other array in atomic way after I write the cached volume there.; And get rid of the RW mutex completely.; Yeah, it can be regarded as a kind of special 3D geometry database; It's not uncommon to have 20M+ elements - the cache is also actually containing their centroids + volumes - so 16 bytes per entry -> easy 300 MB+ memory; Yeah, I'm doing this already.; It speeds up whole computation really a lot",0

If so, simplifies my life as I don't have to take all the f's back out for compiling on ARM; guess it doesn't matter at all since I already f'd things up :D; ARM will treat them the same whether running my math libraries as double or float; Thanks!; I may try float math on arm anyway, if it's precise enough for my purposes I need all the oomph I can get; I'm starting with signed 16 bit int PCM samples cause that's the only way it'd let me open up the input device &gt;.&gt; then converting to double for math, then to float for final output (cause it doesn't support playing double PCM samples &gt;.> signed 16 bit int or 32 bit float). I wonder what the cutoff is for when double math would be noticeably better than float math when the final result has to be float anyway; closer look... there is a difference when the number has enough decimal places that it don't fit in single... float divbypi(short sample) { return static_cast&lt;float> sample) / 3.1415926535897943383279; } - that's doing double math then converting back to float. if i put f there, it's just single precision float math. so my m_pi define just needs to be a float literal i guess. i think that's yje only one long enough; float literal when the samples are float, anyway",0

6402_irc_opengl,slavik,when show a display list be used?,0
6402_irc_opengl,memfr0b,that's about 110 megs :/,0
6402_irc_opengl,slavik,float is 4 bytes,0
6402_irc_opengl,dataangel,"memfr0b: Yeah, I figured it was pretty big.; memfr0b: although I could get rid of the 4th color value (alpha always is 255) then my colors won't be 4 byte aligned and I hear that slows things down; memfr0b: I'm already drawing using triangle strips, so I'm not sure how to compress it anymore.",0
6402_irc_opengl,memfr0b,that'd cut it down to 103megs,0
6402_irc_opengl,dog4,how do you get 103 MB?,0
6402_irc_opengl,dataangel,"memfr0b: I remember reading somewhere that Nvidia cards will swap in this situation, but that ati cards won't.",0
6402_irc_opengl,dog4,i get only 40,0
6402_irc_opengl,memfr0b,you could try SHORTs for vertex position; but that's prolly plenty slow,0
6402_irc_opengl,dataangel,memfr0b: 1100x1100> 65536 means can't use shorts; I read somewhere that using unsigned shorts was faster than unsigned ints.,0
6402_irc_opengl,memfr0b,isn't that two dimensional?,0
6402_irc_opengl,dataangel,but they don't have enough range; memfr0b: What do you mean?,0
6402_irc_opengl,memfr0b,"1100 in x, 1100 in y",0
6402_irc_opengl,dataangel,"memfr0b: Right but for indexing it's still 1100x1100 hexagons total, so 1100*1100*6 vertices, which is way bigger than a short.",0
6402_irc_opengl,memfr0b,"no, not shorts for indices; for vertex position",0
6402_irc_opengl,dataangel,memfr0b: Oh... hadn't thought of doing that.,0
6402_irc_opengl,memfr0b,it's probably slow as hell; and that,0
6402_irc_opengl,dataangel,hrm...,0
6402_irc_opengl,memfr0b,83megs if you store two-dimensions only,0
6402_irc_opengl,dataangel,I do store two dimensions only,0
6402_irc_opengl,dog4,nm,0
6402_irc_opengl,dataangel,And there aren't any extensions for compressing vertexes or colors? The vertexes are very regularly spaced so it seems like there should be some extension or something...,0
6402_irc_opengl,dog4,you can't compress the vertex data,0
6402_irc_opengl,memfr0b,"well, with shaders you can do whatever you wnat",0
6402_irc_opengl,dog4,"i dont quite understand why you have to draw that many vertices at once, though",0
6402_irc_opengl,dataangel,dog4: I'm just rendering a hexagonal plot and think it'd be a lot cooler to have it always render in real time and be nicely resizeable rather than prerendering it to a texture.; memfr0b: I could use shaders for this? @_@,0
6402_irc_opengl,dog4,"just do some culling; you wont be seeing the whole plot all the time, will you?",0
6402_irc_opengl,dataangel,"dog4: Unfortunately, yes ;P",0
6402_irc_opengl,dog4,"render smaller batches, then",0
6402_irc_opengl,memfr0b,that doesn't help much with storage,0
6402_irc_opengl,dataangel,dog4: Doesn't that require me to delete VBOs and recreate them every frame though? that sounds hella expensive,0
6402_irc_opengl,dog4,"dont think so; you could have multiple smaller ones, methinks",0
6402_irc_opengl,memfr0b,dataangel: if you can think of a scheme to maybe fit the two vertex coords into a single flaot or something,0
6402_irc_opengl,dog4,if the out of memory thing is a driver issue; or you can just stick with vertex arrays,0
6402_irc_opengl,dataangel,"dog4: I could split it up into smaller VBOs, but if the net number of them still results in more data than I have VRAM I don't see how that would help",0
6402_irc_opengl,memfr0b,"well, it'd use as much vram as possible",0
6402_irc_opengl,dog4,vram should not be a limit,0
6402_irc_opengl,memfr0b,and only have the rest in system memory,0
6402_irc_opengl,dog4,it should just page out to ram,0
6402_irc_opengl,dataangel,memfr0b: Eh? Then why would I be getting out of memory errors?; oh you mean code in the paging by hand?,0
6402_irc_opengl,dog4,"no, it's the driver's problem",0
6402_irc_opengl,dataangel,"well, it's the cruddy ati linux driver :P",0
6402_irc_opengl,dog4,but you could do it by hand if the driver is crap,0
6402_irc_opengl,memfr0b,it apparently is ;),0
6402_irc_opengl,dog4,apparently,0
6402_irc_opengl,memfr0b,you could use a bunch of smaller vbos and fall back to regular vertex array once you get oom,0
6402_irc_opengl,dataangel,after an oom error opengl is in indeterminate state though isn't it?,0
6402_irc_opengl,memfr0b,right :(,0
6402_irc_opengl,dog4,"i still suggest trying a bunch of smaller VBOs, maybe the driver can handle that",0
7081_irc_opengl,tafa,"Uhm hi. I'm trying to know at what FPS my anitation will be running But I have a problem. When I use the time...functions in the std libs, it just takes too much CPU-Power to iterate and get the time every loop.; How can I reduce this Cpu-.Drag?",1
7081_irc_opengl,tahooie,"tafa, you could check the time every 10 or 100 frames, and compute accordingly",2
7081_irc_opengl,tafa,Sorry I was busy. So that may get a bit undetailed like in some millisecs..; right?,0
7081_irc_opengl,tahooie,"tafa, it would give you a more averaged result that would be less affected by momentary slowdowns (like when the OS decides to do something)",0
7081_irc_opengl,tafa,Okay- if I were to just check the current FPS that wont be that harmful But when doing animations?; Should I use the same..style?,0
7081_irc_opengl,tahooie,"tafa, maybe i'm not understanding exactly what your doing. Usually the check to the time function is trivial (as far as I know)",0
7081_irc_opengl,tafa,"interrupting a bit, Tahooie; how do you do animation in your programs? Just loop and check every iteration of the loop?",0
7081_irc_opengl,tahooie,"tafa, render the scene, update the scene, then render it again. every frame I calculate the time since the last frame, and use that timeslice value to know how much to move the objects in the scene for the next frame.",0
7081_irc_opengl,tafa,"tahooie,(interrupting again) so by saying you check the time every frame you mean you are checking it every iteration of a loop?",0
7081_irc_opengl,tahooie,"tafa, check the time elapsed between drawing to the screen - every frame of animation; tafa, the frames are usually drawn in a loop of some sorts, so yes.",0
7081_irc_opengl,tafa,But what if I want to draw something every 1/24 of a second and not every iteration of a loop?,0
7081_irc_opengl,tahooie,"tafa, then you need to set some sort of timer. The OS can send an event when the timer goes off",0
7081_irc_opengl,tafa,How can I do that?!,0
7081_irc_opengl,tahooie,"tafa, what environment are you coding in?",0
7081_irc_opengl,tafa,both dos and unix.,0
7081_irc_opengl,tahooie,are you using glut or sdl tafa ?,0
7081_irc_opengl,tafa,well on unix glut and on win win32api; go ahead and learn it. it nice...; okay okay. So tahooie it there a way to use this timer with both platforms?,0
7081_irc_opengl,tahooie,"tafa, it depends a lot on what kind of app you are writing. If its a windowed app with a little animation, then use wxWidgets, and i'm sure it has timers.; tafa, when I say windowed I mean a window with buttons, an opengl window, etc",0
7081_irc_opengl,tafa,"sure, and what about timers for UNIX?",0
7081_irc_opengl,tahooie,"tafa, look up SDL. I havn't used it yet but will probably switch over to it in the future. It is cross platform, and I wouldn't be surprised if it doesn't have a timer; tafa, and it has a bunch of other nice things like image loading, input, etc",0
7081_irc_opengl,tafa,Well yeah. But I guess I like doing somethings the hard way...; ANYWay! I will do the timer stuff thanks.; yes it is. and gcc is also poop;),0
7081_irc_opengl,tahooie,"tafa, good luck.",0
7081_irc_opengl,tafa,thank you. tahooie.; Hey! that's I love DevC++,0
7081_irc_opengl,tahooie,"tafa, i think you're wasting time, a toolkit is better. But suit yourself :); survey: What is the best (eg, least poopy) compiler?",0
7081_irc_opengl,HellDragon,so dev c++ is poop,0
7081_irc_opengl,tafa,"hehe... I know I know but I think I can learn a lot more when doing it myself, right?",0
7081_irc_opengl,yuriks,"IMO, gcc; tafa: not necessarily; you would be learning winapi, which, IMO isn't all that desirable if are doing games...; heheheh",0
7081_irc_opengl,HellDragon,and yuriks: use mistear clean instead of vim for ur bath,0
7081_irc_opengl,tafa,"yuriks , didn't you know that DirectX is the best!?",0
7081_irc_opengl,HellDragon,youll see big change like day and night,0
7081_irc_opengl,yuriks,haha,0
7081_irc_opengl,HellDragon,vim is poop for bath; and poop just dirt the bath,0
7081_irc_opengl,yuriks,haha,0
7214_irc_opengl,Jernej,hi; what is the best way to use GLSL in a way that will work on most old (like NVidia FX series) and future cards?,1
7214_irc_opengl,gltron,"jernej: know the shader 2.0 limitations, and write your programs so they don't hit any of those limits",2
7214_irc_opengl,Jernej,umm; i meant should i use the ARB way or opengl 2.0 way?; i only need a fragment shader,0
7214_irc_opengl,gltron,oh. that doesn't matter,0
7214_irc_opengl,Jernej,what do you mean?,0
7214_irc_opengl,gltron,"wow, that has to be the most complicated 'draw 4 triangles' program ever; right, because you commented the somewhat insane drawing code out and inserted bad drawing code for 4 triangles; client &amp; server states are what makes opengl work somewhat performant over a network link; noway-: the reason your triangles don't show is because they are at z=0; but you have a perspective projection which clips at 0.1; insert a glTranslatef(0,0,-20); or so before the first draw call, and you should be fine",0
7214_irc_opengl,noway-,ok,0
7214_irc_opengl,gltron,"or better, use gluLookAt(); also, throw away that example and use a 10 lines app that you actually understand; GLUT is your friend (at least for a while)",0
7214_irc_opengl,noway-,I dont know if I can use GLUT for this assignment,0
7214_irc_opengl,gltron,time to find out :-),0
7214_irc_opengl,noway-,"hehe, ok, thanks gltron",0
7214_irc_opengl,gltron,"if it's about OpenGL, you should be able to. if it's about windows programming, probably not",0
7347_irc_opengl,feelgood_,uh that isn't GPU assembly code; that is probably NV_fragment_program code; or something similar; which under the NV drivers is effectively what GLSL is compiled to; or at least this used to be the case (i.e. w/ the FX series and the NV4x drivers -- this could have changed though),1
7347_irc_opengl,tamlin,"feelgood_: Right, but as he stated it was for an nvidia GPU...",2
7347_irc_opengl,feelgood_,so? I'm just stating that it isn't what the underlying HW actually deals with,0
7347_irc_opengl,tamlin,I can't even begin to imagine how many layers of parsers there are embedded in those drivers. :-),0
7347_irc_opengl,feelgood_,i.e. its nothing more than a intermediate language,0
7347_irc_opengl,tamlin,Agreed.,0
7347_irc_opengl,feelgood_,yeah more than 2 I'd say; i.e. GLSL -&gt; NVfp* -> something else,0
7347_irc_opengl,tamlin,"But it still _is_ an assembler language, even that it's not directly compilable to machinecode.",0
7347_irc_opengl,feelgood_,is probably how it goes; since you don't really need anything more for optimization; nah I wouldn't say that it is; namely because you still have zero idea as to whether the GPU is actually capable of executing those opcodes directly; and in the CPU world it generally isn't so abstract :D; then again it can be...; haha you could run a strings on the driver or something and see if you get anything interesting back,0
7347_irc_opengl,tamlin,feelgood_: Compare f.ex. x86 assembler with the micro-ops. Quite a large difference there too.,0
7347_irc_opengl,feelgood_,exactly which is why I said that it can be,0
7347_irc_opengl,absence,"feelgood_, libGLcore.so.1 contains a lot of shader instruction strings near the end ;)",0
7347_irc_opengl,tamlin,"feelgood_: Actually, for nvidia drivers you nowadays have to do some (simple, but still) decrypting to find the Quack stuff (but it's still there - only in kernel-mode this time).",0
7347_irc_opengl,feelgood_,the fact of the matter is that most of today's CPUs tend to work like that; namely because you can decouple your HW from the programmer's assumptions; yeah I'll have to try that sometime myself... it might be interesting to see what we can find,0
7347_irc_opengl,absence,"even if the instructions listed aren't exactly what the hardware runs, at least i can see if i write some really daft glsl code that turns into a whole block of stuff. there seems to be quite a few different ways to get to the same result in glsl",0
7347_irc_opengl,feelgood_,yeah well even using cgc to go from GLSL into NVfp* can help you with that; in fact I generally go that route,0
7347_irc_opengl,absence,"oh, it can do that? cool",0
7347_irc_opengl,feelgood_,because at least there you can assume that the NVfp* layer is infinitely closer to the actual underlying HW than GLSl will ever be; yeah I've been doing this for the last 2 or so years :D,0
7347_irc_opengl,tamlin,Does ATI also grok nv fp asm?,0
7347_irc_opengl,absence,"heh, looking at some cgc output on google, and it's pretty much the same kind of output i get. !!FP1.0 and all",0
7347_irc_opengl,feelgood_,its really too bad that we don't have an equivalent strategy for ATI GPUs though,0
7347_irc_opengl,absence,feelgood_ thanks for the tip,0
7347_irc_opengl,feelgood_,no this will not work for ATI,0
7347_irc_opengl,tamlin,I almost suspected it.,0
7347_irc_opengl,feelgood_,and the extensions you would want to look at (assuming you have a NV4x or better) would be NV_vertex_program3 and NV_fragment_program2; since those extensions are a pretty good match for the GLSL runtime; (i.e. in terms of what you can do),0
7347_irc_opengl,absence,"for now i'll just look at the code generated, i don't really want to write nvidia-specific code. i'm pretty new to glsl, and just want to get an example of how the code gets ""compiled"", even if it's not the same on ati",0
7347_irc_opengl,tamlin,"GLSL is the way to go if you want vendor neutrality, so I think that's what you should focus at.",0
7347_irc_opengl,absence,yep,0
7347_irc_opengl,tamlin,"I ARB wanted us to be non-vendor-neutral, we'd all be using glide. :-)",0
7347_irc_opengl,absence,"shudder; speaking of arb, does anyone know if they are working on making FBO an arb extension?; i don't really know where to look for that kind of news",0
7347_irc_opengl,tamlin,"They must be, but then again there are other issues in the pipe many may or may not like. A good source to keep an eye at is the advanced forum at opengl.org.",0
7347_irc_opengl,absence,"tamlin, may or may not like? anything that you can sum up in a sentence? :)",0
7347_irc_opengl,tamlin,"absence: Gimme a minute or two, and I'll ee if I can find the URL.",0
7347_irc_opengl,absence,"tamlin, cool!",0
7347_irc_opengl,tamlin,"absence: <a href=""http://www.opengl.org/discussion_boards/ubb/ultimatebb.php?ubb=get_topic;f=3;t=014340"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.opengl.org/discussion_boards/ubb/ultimatebb.php?ubb=get_topic;f=3;t=014340</a>",0
7347_irc_opengl,absence,"wow, that sounds cool",0
8195_irc_opengl,stefand,another question:; which is the best way to read and write directly to the frame buffer?; glDrawPixels? should I upload the data to a texture and draw a textured quad?; Hmm. My radeon M9 doesn't have GL_ARB_framebuffer_object or pixel buffers; LockRect on render targets; games use it to show intro movies and stuff,1
8195_irc_opengl,dolphin,"stefand: indeed, gorky17 does",2
8195_irc_opengl,stefand,"some games like system shock 2 use it to draw the HUD every frame; nope, read-write; games can take screenshots this way",0
8195_irc_opengl,gltron,"stefand: yes, but not for the movies",0
8195_irc_opengl,stefand,"true, but I don't know what the app is going to do",0
8195_irc_opengl,gltron,"read-write lockrect is extremly slow even in DX, iirc",0
8195_irc_opengl,stefand,it requests a pointer to the frame buffer memory from me; and tells me when it is finished using it,0
8195_irc_opengl,gltron,"yes, but it gives you the flags",0
8195_irc_opengl,stefand,READONLY,0
8195_irc_opengl,gltron,then you do a glReadPixels,0
8195_irc_opengl,stefand,but only nice games do that,0
8195_irc_opengl,gltron,and a glDrawPixels upon Unlock if it was read-write,0
8195_irc_opengl,stefand,"yup, but this is slow; it is enought to show intro movies at 640x480",0
8195_irc_opengl,gltron,"if they use read-write, they get what they deserve",0
8195_irc_opengl,stefand,tell this my users who want to play their favorite game :-(,0
8195_irc_opengl,gltron,"for movies, give them a (empty) memory surface, and use glTexSubImage2D to draw &amp; upload",0
8195_irc_opengl,dolphin,stefand: tell them to buy real linux games from us :),0
8195_irc_opengl,gltron,show me the d3d game that locks read-write and then only writes,0
8195_irc_opengl,stefand,"Well, there is no write only flag in dx8 and dx9; in dx7 there is, but it won't help",0
8195_irc_opengl,gltron,"I doubt that,lemme check",0
8195_irc_opengl,stefand,because if it locks the whole buffer and modifies the half buffer; The rest must remain unchanged,0
8195_irc_opengl,gltron,"to LockRect for write-only access; there, you pass D3DLOCK_DISCARD; everybody does that",0
8195_irc_opengl,stefand,"well, do not rely on the correctness of DirectX games and the DirectX documentation",0
8195_irc_opengl,gltron,"the DirectX documentation is pretty good, I've been doing D3D in my job for 4 years",0
8195_irc_opengl,stefand,it is better than the usual msdn stuff; but if you try to write an implementation you will see things that are incorrect,0
8195_irc_opengl,dolphin,gltron: good documentation doesn't mean it'd be used,0
8195_irc_opengl,stefand,"can you think of any gl stuff that can take the performance of glReadPixels down?; I found out that I have to disable the depth test for glDrawPixels, otherwise it gives ~1 fps",0
8195_irc_opengl,dolphin,stefand: using non-native format,0
8195_irc_opengl,stefand,"there is something simmilar with glReadPixels, but I couldn't find anything",0
8195_irc_opengl,dolphin,but OpenGL makes it almost impossible to guess the native format,0
8195_irc_opengl,cplusplus,does someone use mmx or sse?,0
8195_irc_opengl,dolphin,cplusplus: go away with your off-topic and multi-channel messages; use google,0
8195_irc_opengl,cplusplus,its a general question;); google will not help in my case,0
8195_irc_opengl,dolphin,and thus off-topic,0
8195_irc_opengl,cplusplus,do you now a sse/mmx channel on irc?,0
8195_irc_opengl,dolphin,##asm?,0
8195_irc_opengl,cplusplus,thx,0
8195_irc_opengl,LtJax,"stefand, the biggest performance penality with glReadPixels is that it is a sync point between cpu and gpu; you can use PBOs to get around that partially",0
8195_irc_opengl,stefand,PBOs won't help because old cards don't support that,0
8195_irc_opengl,dolphin,people don't game on old supports,0
8195_irc_opengl,stefand,"Hm. Even if people always use cards that are new enought to have all funky exts; Alexandre Julliards won't accept it if Wine needs a gf6???? for old games such as Diablo 2; WineD3D uses opengl 1.1 for it's base functionality; and extensions where we can't avoid it; such as fragment and vertex programs for 1.4 shaders; and GLSL for> 2.0 shaders; So I can use PBOs for speedup, but not for base operation",0
8195_irc_opengl,gltron,stefand: so you're saying that Diablo2 uses LockRect without the DISCARD flag while drawing movies?,0
8195_irc_opengl,dolphin,"gltron: he's saying he needs general solution, I think",0
8195_irc_opengl,gltron,"no, he wants to play movies at acceptable speed",0
8195_irc_opengl,stefand,I need a general solution with acceptable speed :-),0
8195_irc_opengl,gltron,"there is none, and D3D doesn't have one either",0
8195_irc_opengl,stefand,Even if the game locks a full 1280x960 surface during rendering,0
8195_irc_opengl,gltron,you're optimizing a case that doesn't exist in practice :-),0
8195_irc_opengl,stefand,system shock 2 :-); others too,0
8195_irc_opengl,gltron,is the source for SS2 out?,0
8195_irc_opengl,stefand,I think I will use some hashing magic to find out which parts of the surface are changed; so I can avoid reading and writing the whole surface every frame,0
8195_irc_opengl,dolphin,aww :P,0
8195_irc_opengl,gltron,"so, SS2 really does a lockrect without DISCARD? you're 100% sure?",0
8195_irc_opengl,stefand,"if ss2 only draws a 32x32 crosshair in the middle of the screen I can avoid reading back the rest; SS2 is dx7, there is no discard flag; there is a writeonly, but this flag doesn't require the game to overwrite everything",0
8195_irc_opengl,gltron,does SS2 use the writeonly flag?,0
8195_irc_opengl,stefand,"I haven't checked that, but I can't make use of it; because the app may lock the whole surface, change a small part and the rest must remain unchanged",0
8195_irc_opengl,gltron,"because *I don't believe any DX game locks the whole screen for read-write* and gets away with it. I just can't think of a way to make that work fast enough, even in DX",0
8195_irc_opengl,stefand,after unlockrect; DX has some SYSTEMMEM cap,0
8195_irc_opengl,gltron,"there. it doesn't lock the screen then, but a system surface",0
8195_irc_opengl,stefand,a frame buffer or texture in systemmem is cheap to lock,0
8195_irc_opengl,gltron,"no readback from the card involved; there's no 'frame buffer' in systemmem, only textures",0
8195_irc_opengl,stefand,Hmm; I haven't checked system shock 2 in detail admitadely,0
8195_irc_opengl,gltron,"see, you're optimizing a case that doesn't exist",0
8195_irc_opengl,dolphin,I'll release a game tomorrow that does that; how abouts then?,0
8195_irc_opengl,gltron,"it'll run at 1 fps, in dx",0
8195_irc_opengl,dolphin,yay,0
8195_irc_opengl,gltron,can't expect OpenGL to run at 60fps,0

8195_irc_opengl,stefand,"I will install ss2 later and check; wait, there are the DirectX sdk demos; they get a hdc to draw fonts on the render target; those run at 9000 fps on windows on a decent card; dx7 sdk demos; I don't know how IDirectDrawSurface7::GetDC or IDirect3DSurface9::GetDC works on windows internally; but I'd expect them to require reading the frame buffer memory; except if windows handles stuff like TextOut in the card; which is what I'm going to to for GetDC in the long tem",0

8740_irc_opengl,chicken_Fire,"I don't think so, I'll check this.; errr how does a trianglestrip with degenerate triangles look like? Repreating the same vertex?",0
8740_irc_opengl,memfr0b,"that's one possibility; any combination that results in a triangle with two parallel sides; or a side with length = 0, same thing",0
8992_irc_opengl,RyanT5000,"could someone suggest a tutorial on pipeline optimization? I've heard about sorting by texture/shader/material/etc., but I have no idea what's *really* important on modern hardware",1
8992_irc_opengl,Andon,"RyanT5000, it's kind of complicated when you start dealing with complicated materials. First and foremost you should sort by opacity and try to collapse passes whenever possible, which will involve sorting by texture.; Sorting by texture's probably the best advice I can give.",2
8992_irc_opengl,RyanT5000,"alright, so try to minimize texture binds?; what's the cost of moving a texture from one texture unit to another, vs. rearranging the texture unit sources?",0
8992_irc_opengl,Andon,Err?; The reason you want to sort by texture is because that significantly reduces the number of draw primitive calls.,0
8992_irc_opengl,RyanT5000,"oh; i always assumed it was to minimize reloading textures; is there a book or site on low-level graphics stuff you'd recommend?; i have a *lot* to learn; i mostly know about OSes, compilers, and traditional caching systems; graphics aren't really something i've had a lot to do with yet, so i don't really feel like i understand the pipeline overall; and the courses i took in college were always glBegin/glEnd based",0
8992_irc_opengl,Andon,I'd actually suggest reading the GDC presentations that NVIDIA and ATI give every year on the topic of optimizing graphics pipelines. I have yet to find a good book on the topic.,0
8992_irc_opengl,RyanT5000,"oh ok, i hadn't thought of that (even though i've read a few of those from time to time); thanks",0
8992_irc_opengl,Andon,"No problem.; Check <a href=""http://www.flipcode.com/articles/dpcolumn_issue01.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.flipcode.com/articles/dpcolumn_issue01.shtml</a>",0
8992_irc_opengl,RyanT5000,what's the deal with display lists/buffer objects?; are they worth using pervasively?,0
8992_irc_opengl,Andon,Indeed. Buffer objects are very important for modern graphics pipelines.,0
8992_irc_opengl,RyanT5000,"alright, i assumed so; what about controlling the texture cache manually?; i did a google search and it seems like the only thing is a proposal in the ARB; is it that unnecessary?; (and if so, why is it different from buffer object caching? they seem like identical problems to me)",0
8992_irc_opengl,Andon,I wouldn't bother writing your own code to try to give the driver hints on texture caching.,0
8992_irc_opengl,RyanT5000,"alright; i'm currently trying to figure out how to make a single abstraction for all the caching in my program; lol; so if i get that straight, i'll probably throw textures in along with it, but with a nonexistant caching policy (just let OpenGL handle it); i gave up on trying to abstract-away the differences between constants passed to shaders and the environment that builtin hardware T&amp;L uses",0
9738_irc_opengl,drstn,"please, where i can find some good tutorial about glEnableClientState",1
9738_irc_opengl,feelgood,"drstn: www.google.com -> search for ""glEnableClientState""; well its a pretty wide spanning topic; yeah offline rendering is quite a bit different (in terms of what is viable) than rendering via a RT API like GL; actually you can draw pixels :P; its just not recommended; since the old style blitting paths aren't highly accelerated; exactly",2
9738_irc_opengl,drstn,how is the client? the card or the main CPU?,0
9738_irc_opengl,feelgood,of course DrawPixels is slow as fuck; at least for anything over 128 x 128; ah I've used it quite a bit,0
9738_irc_opengl,pwuertz,glDrawPixels.... omg,0
9738_irc_opengl,feelgood,its one of those things which used to come in handy when dealing w/ image / video data and such; of course now the texturing path(s) handle this sort of thing at ~100x the performance hehe,0
9738_irc_opengl,pwuertz,"hmm... is glDrawPixels obselete or still useful, if you just want to blit an image over the screen?; ok... stick with textures ^^",0
9738_irc_opengl,feelgood,"no its not obsolete; its just that its generally viable for a limited number of cases (performance wise); like anything in GL for that matter hehe; a ""one trick pony"" if you will :P",0
9738_irc_opengl,pwuertz,so if I want to blit an image on the screen... should I use drawpixels or a textured quad?,0
9738_irc_opengl,rockz,is red book good to start with opengl ?,0
9738_irc_opengl,feelgood,wrt most of the GPUs I've dealt w/ the performance curve tends to fall off sharply once you go beyond 128 x 128 or so; I'd use texturing for that; rockz: yes,0
9738_irc_opengl,pwuertz,"rockz, read the nehe tutorials for opengl startup",0
9738_irc_opengl,feelgood,assuming that texturing is viable for your code; meh start w/ the red book; NeHe is a piss poor site from which to learn GL from,0
9738_irc_opengl,pwuertz,why?,0
9738_irc_opengl,feelgood,its OK for some things...; because they don't discuss the *why* rather than just the *how*; meh NeHe allows you to get up and running relatively quickly,0
9738_irc_opengl,vIkSiT,"feelgood, which is good if your major concentration is say, AI and all you need is a graph drawn in 3D :)",0
9738_irc_opengl,feelgood,it doesn't do anything if you want to learn the GL API though... which is my problem w/ it I suppose,0
9738_irc_opengl,vIkSiT,"well, learning by experience is out there - I learned opengl mostly through following nehes techniques along with a lot of other pieces of code which did something i liked, and cross referring stuff to the redbook; the red book imo isn't a lot of fun by itself even if it does cover a lot of detail",0
9738_irc_opengl,feelgood,well its also not meant to be fun; its meant as a reference; like any CS text for that matter hehe,0

12913_irc_opengl,ville,basically opengl does a lot of the work for you. You just tell the location and orientation of a quad and draw it.
