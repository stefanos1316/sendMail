428,421594,Jae,I'd suggest `django-rest-framework` for django. Will make the API construction easier,2
428,421633,Lilla,Jae: so using a simple ajax request using axios or jquery i can post my contents over this API to the database?,0
428,421705,Jae,"and if you're not doing so, use `create-react-app` to get a good project boilerplate with a very high quality webpack configuration; so, what happens is when you wire up `axios` in your react app, it creates a request to the server via GET, PUT, POST, etc; and while you can think of this as similar to jquery's `$.ajax()` method, its a little different",2
428,421709,Lilla,ok,0
428,421717,Jae,have you done anything like this before?,0
428,421784,Lilla,"no thats why im kind of confused; ive been able to feed data into my react components; but now posting to the django setup; its not so clear in my mind; im going through the DRF tutorial; dos my axios post request need to point to a view URL that takes in a post, grabs what i send and stores?",0
428,421861,Jae,"correct; and if you're using DRF, the URL is mapped to at least an `APIView` implementation; which contains a `get(self, request, ...)` or `post(self, request, ...)` implementation",0
428,421892,Lilla,ok; so all that classic jazz if request.GET; etc.,0
428,421903,Jae,out the window,0
428,421962,Lilla,"Could you point me to any documentation, guides, tuts that i could look up? i fail to communicate what i am searching on google; brings up different stuff; a simplified example is what i need from somewhere to just establish an easy proof of work",0
428,421986,Jae,"server side or client side?; I mean, the DRF tutorial is pretty good",0
428,422001,Lilla,yeh perhaps client sided; sending the post request to the DRF API,0
428,422005,Jae,ah ok,0
428,422005,Lilla,processing it,0
428,422058,Jae,"<https://daveceddia.com/ajax-requests-in-react/>; so that would help client side; server side, really depends on _what_ data you're sending; and whether you need to seiralize it to a model instance",2
428,422092,Lilla,yeh i would i'll be sending json to the database; thanks for the help though; it confirms im heading in the right direction with DRF,0
428,422160,Jae,"yeah; and what makes things easy is it can handle the serialization/deserialization for you; so you can send in a model representation via json from your client; and it will deserialize it to a model instance which you can do more stuff with; and then sending data back out to the client, it will serialize models to JSON",0
428,422195,Lilla,"ok nice, and just ajax post to the url view which receives the data",0

429,425868,Reynaldo,"I'm evaluating celery/redis alternatives for task queuing and scheduling. Someone mentioned redislite and apscheduler. Does apscheduler do task queuing or just scheduling? Also, any other alternatives?; This is being used for a Django environment.",1
429,425981,Lawanda,`concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor` is good at queuing when you don't need ETA scheduling,2
429,426244,Reynaldo,"So if I'm just firing off a task (not scheduling), that would be a good way to go?; I like that.",0
429,426419,Benton,"Redis-lite would be if you kept celery to make it easier to distribute, otherwise APScheduler could call manage.py commands in your app and be deadsimple",2
429,426608,Reynaldo,"ah. gotcha.; I was looking at if there was maybe en embedded task queue manager, but I'm not coming up with much. APScheduler looks to be a good route.; Can you fire off tasks immediately without scheduling them using apscheduler?",0
429,426876,Benton,"Yeah I think the decorator returns the original function. So you could just call it directly iirc; Interesting thought, embedded task queue manager. I think in many cases someone would just use Cron or windows scheduler",0
429,427070,Reynaldo,True.,0

430,431761,Cassie,"hello everyone, I've requirement where dataset is large like 10 millions records, i want to use django rest framework in order to provide that data. Question : which one is the best ORM which is efficient for large datasets? 1. Django ORM 2. SQL alchemy",1
430,431831,Cesar,SQLalchemy is more performant especially if you're using Core.,2
430,431946,Cassie,Cesar: thanks for the suggestion. I've those data on microsoft SQL server.; would like to move to postgresql.,0
430,431985,Jae,"yeah, will be cheaper in the long run; no sql server license :slightly_smiling_face:",0
430,431989,Cesar,Cassie: <http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/faq/performance.html>,0
430,432082,Cassie,how about django ORM? Not good from performance point of view?,0
430,432164,Agueda,if you use sqlalchemy you can reflect your mssql database and then create its exact schema in postgres.; and you could use sqlacodegen to create the models.; i've done this very thing to move a .net application to python.,0
430,432168,Makeda,"I think ""performance on large data sets"" and ""ORM"" are mutually exclusive. ORMs exist for development convenience, not high performance.",0
430,432188,Jae,"^; and furthermore, you should use pagination and such to actually retrieve the data",0
430,432191,Makeda,"That's not to say you _can't_ get good performance - you can, if you know the ORM well and/or you have access to low level commands like SQLAlchemy Core",0
430,432199,Cassie,Ultimate plan is this only. Move web API .Net to django API.,0
430,432209,Makeda,"But they're not designed for that purpose, and will probably impede you somewhat",0
430,432227,Jae,and there are times you will have to write and execute raw sql,0
430,432229,Agueda,sqlalchemy's orm does a pretty good job in general.,2
430,432333,Makeda,"It depends a lot on the nature of the querying. If you have good indexing set up and you're only working with a few records at a time, the ORM usually doesn't care if there are 10, 10000, or 1000000 rows in a DB; But if you're doing ""big data"" stuff where you routinely hit large amounts of the table... that's a different matter",0
430,432343,Chia,reducing joins helps a lot too,0
430,432367,Makeda,"yup, ORM joins are often nowhere near as efficient as raw SQL joins",0
430,432429,Jae,one thing I like about django is you can print out the sql query for a given db access; and then look at it to see if you can improve it,0
430,432432,Krissy,SQLAlchemy can do this too!,0
430,432485,Jae,"by django, I mean the django framework, not the ORM; since it is possible to replace the default ORM with sqlalchemy (though I've never done this), but the API is largely the same",0
430,432702,Agueda,"yea, you can mix sqlalchemy and django orm. it's all just python at the end of the day. however, if you swap out one for the other you lose all the benefits of the django orm and how it integrates with the framework.",2
430,432991,Cesar,If performance is a factor than use SQLAlchemy core to work on this large data set. If deadlines are more of a factor that use Django ORM since you're already use DRF. Just make sure to use eager loading on relationships where you can to optimize queries. <http://ses4j.github.io/2015/11/23/optimizing-slow-django-rest-framework-performance/>,2
431,434030,Nita,any good tutorials you all would recommend on packaging for somebody who's never done it?,1
434,455519,Kerstin,hey what is the best way to write a list of json objects to a file; I was thinking of writing it into a csv; where each row is a basically a json object or should I save it as a json file?,1
434,455571,Benton,"Kerstin: You should probably either do a CSV, which would mean breaking the JSON into columns in your CSV or just a file where each line is a new JSON object; You could make the JSON a column of the CSV, technically, but that would be kind of awkward to use again",2
434,455592,Kerstin,yeah that is very awkward and hard to use I am thinking of latter,0
434,455702,Benton,Are you going to want to search them for anything? If so - you may be best served to dump the contents into a database so you can query and such,0
434,455730,Kerstin,yeah right now I just want to work with files and if needed we can move to db,0
434,455755,Joaquina,how big is the file,0
434,455817,Kerstin,its quite small 1200x250x4 float array is basically what it is,0
434,455820,Joaquina,dump it as json then either transfor in refine in a matter of seconds or drop it on here if its small enough: <https://konklone.io/json/>,2
434,455918,Kerstin,oh it is better if I automate it I just dumped as a json object; thanks guys!,0
446,673548,Makeda,"Is there a generally-accepted 'best' unit-testing package? Or is it a subjective choice between nose, py.test, etc?",1
446,673712,Krissy,`pytest`!; no thinking required,2
446,673781,Makeda,"What are the advantages? I'm not a big fan of the setup/teardown syntax, but I could get used to it.",0

449,837167,Jeana,Hi everyone. Which service or tool for crawling website with javascript? For me i used phantomjs and selenium. But their performance is so poor.,1
449,837247,Heike,"I often use `requests` in combination with `BeautifulSoup` (using the `lxml` parser).; However, that's not a JavaScript solution. Sorry!",2
449,837774,Lawanda,Jeana: is this some sort of single page web app?,0
449,838045,Jeana,Kind of. Because some pages need to excute javasript for rendering full content. So i have to find some browser which can excute javascript for making dynamic crawler.; But according to real life experience. I see phantomjs or selenium is so slow; one minute they can only render 5-6 page; Which cannot serve my purpose,0
449,838060,Heike,Maybe spread the workload out to multiple VMs and let each do a part of the URLspace?,0
449,838136,Lawanda,Jeana: can't you just repeat queries that javascript is making and get the data from the backend directly?,0
449,838250,Jeana,Lawanda: Can i make DM with you ?,0
449,838322,Lawanda,Let's keep our conversation public; I'm not the only one who can help you,0
449,838532,Jeana,Ok. I’m afraid that i will mess our channel. So the problem is i’m making a crawler which can extract the article main content of any news website.; So for making that i have to get the css and javascript for detecting which is article page and navigation page.; My only bottleneck is page rendering tools. For this i used phantomjs and selenium.; But with their pool performances i can’t really use this for production,0
449,838545,Lawanda,"Yeah, you said that a couple of times already.",0
449,838596,Willa,and not the only who need to solve it,0
449,838607,Lawanda,Jeana: have you seen my previous question?,0
449,838901,Jeana,"Yup already. But it can’t help. Some web pages make different requests ajax for rendering full content each page. So if i write some algorithm for detecting those request format and fake it. It will make my issue extremely complex. So for reducing the complex, i used some service which can return me the full content after javascript executing.; Lawanda: and sorry for repeating my issue. I just want to centralize again all of my issue.",0
449,839025,Lawanda,"You still have to parse the returned page, right? Then how parsing different parts is it more complex than rendering everything and parsing parts as a whole?; You don't need to write an algorithm to detect requests. You just need to open the page, to look into web inspector and copy-paste related queries from ""Network"" tab; That's pretty much it",0
449,839334,Jeana,Because I have to find a way to deal with “Any” pages not for specific one as you suggest.,0
449,839469,Lawanda,"You have to find a way to deal with all pages you're interested in, yes. If that's such a huge problem, then your only way is to use selenium/headless chrome/whatever",2
449,839598,Jeana,"Yes, so i want to ask if someone had deal with this problem already.",0
449,839875,Heike,"Jeana: Apparently your problem is slowness and lack of processing capacity. Maybe using multiple machines is an option?; I mean, instead of machine 1 processing news sites A, B and C in succession, you start 3 machines, where machine 1 will process news site A, machine 2 news site B and machine 3 news site C. That will give a 3x speedup.",2
449,840107,Jeana,Yes i’ve already done that. But i wonder if there is some tool can do this better than phantomjs either selenium. Right now i used 3 servers but only 200 page/ minute has been rendered. I used cache and proxy and image replacing for reducing the time cost. But it is only slightly better,0
449,840187,Krissy,"sorry to interject, i haven't read everything, but one instance per core (minus 1-2 cores for main process) gives us about 30 headless browsers per machine; on a second-to-largest GCC instance; also, headless chrome :heart:",0
449,840520,Jeana,I used to open 10 instance of headless browser per machine. But the time cost increases with instance of headless browser. More instance ---&gt; more time for rendering.; I don’t know if i’m doing something wrong with that,0
449,840526,Krissy,how many cores on these machines?,0
449,840544,Jeana,8 cores.,0
449,840567,Krissy,10 is too many then :slightly_smiling_face:,0
449,840636,Jeana,Anywho thanks for your suggestion with headless chrome. I will take a try with it; :slightly_smiling_face:,0
449,845017,Jae,"so, phantom is notorious for being slow, and having problems; not surprising since its been a one-person project for a number of years now. given the challenges of browser development, phantom's state of functionality is impressive with that restriction; however, it is now deprecated and no longer supported since headless chrome came out; and unfortunately, this is an instance of where horizontal scaling will have to be used, where you distribute the tasks to be executed among a cluster of similar instances; just like with celery workers, there's a sweet spot that can be hit with tasks on each machine for optimium efficiency, but that takes alot of experimenting to do.; Jeana: what instance size are you running this on, and what provider? AWS, GCC, Azure?",0
449,845315,Jeana,It’s running on my own server company. Not provided by any companies above.,0
449,845480,Jae,then your only option is to either reduce the rate of crawling or add more hardware,2
449,845536,Jae,because the primary issue is rendering the page and there is a significant lack of options for that,0
449,845740,Jeana,Thanks for your advice Jason.,0

482,1298699,Heike,Pamella: Do you already know how to program?,0
482,1298773,Pamella,Yeah. Looking for something more design focused and best practices; Currently reading idiomatic python; But that's more of like a skim,0
482,1298804,Heike,"Ah ok. I came from C++ a long time ago, and I found the standard Python tutorial quite a good read. And I found some 'Python for C++ programmers' online texts.",2
482,1298930,Pamella,Not a big cpp fan haha,0
482,1298997,Heike,I had no choice.,0
482,1299048,Benton,Effective Python is good,2
482,1299572,Gillian,Pamella: <http://www.allitebooks.com/fluent-python/>,2
482,1300757,Pamella,Will take a look at both of those books :)) hopefully I can find a free download. The fluent python one is an early release; Meh I think the early release will be fine; Gillian: Thank you very much !,0
482,1303146,Lamont,Heike: thanks for the link! do you know if it's significantly different than if I use jquery to do this? I had trouble with targeting the correct element,0
484,1307290,Hassie,"Hi, I need a suggestion. I am planning to start a new project for logging user analytics using MongoDB. Which framework will be better to use with Mongo - Flask or Django?",1
484,1307521,Agueda,flask,2
484,1307552,Agueda,at one point in time around django 1.4 mongo was great with django but then ppl stopped maintaining some core libraries.,0
484,1307579,Benton,"=+1 for that use case; Though if you are doing user analytics, you may need something lower latency since that may be a ton of events",0
484,1307814,Agueda,i built my recent highlighter with elastic search. it worked really well. I would imagine throwing kibana on there could make for a neat analytics platform.; <https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana>,2
484,1307818,Hassie,Agueda: Can you tell me more about it?,0
484,1307990,Agueda,i’ve built an elk stack for logging at my old place of employment. it depends on what you mean by analytics :wink:.; you could analyze the data with scripts and use things like stochastic gradient descent and things like that or you can build dashboards.; not sure how you’re trying to check out these events.; we used the logs to determine if there were issues in the network.,0
484,1308001,Hassie,"I will log request, pageviews and other user actions.",0
484,1308056,Agueda,do you have any experience with flask?; or python web frameworks?; i try not to assume things.,0
484,1308056,Hassie,Yes I've decent experience on django,0
484,1308076,Agueda,k; just a sec let me bust out a code sample.,0
484,1308140,Hassie,I can learn flask fast; pycharm is slow :stuck_out_tongue:,0
484,1308219,Agueda,i also had to get my kid off of the table.,0
484,1308289,Hassie,okay,0
484,1308359,Agueda,for user analytics you could use django or flask. to get the user events you’ll need some sort of middleware. i’m not talking about that part. what i’m showing is how to get data into elastic search.; once you have data in elastic search then the kibana parts comes into play but you will also need to figure that part out.,2
484,1308552,Hassie,ok; Waiting :slightly_smiling_face:,0
484,1308566,Agueda,"ya, wondering if i should make a big gist. there are several things involved.",0
484,1308615,Hassie,ok take your time :slightly_smiling_face:,0
484,1308730,Agueda,dang i need to edit this in a bigger window. lol,0
484,1308805,Agueda,"either way, in flask you’ll need to do something like that and establish a connection with elastic search.; when your app starts up.; there may be a flask-extension for it already; where you can simply add in the right settings.",0
484,1308869,Hassie,ok then,0
484,1309221,Agueda,i’ve updated it with the model. you need to create a model to describe how your document is structured.,0
484,1309318,Agueda,oh cool. yea you can use this :smiley: <https://github.com/chiangf/Flask-Elasticsearch>,0
484,1309437,Hassie,You used Flask + ES + Kibana?,0
484,1309488,Agueda,no kibana; in my project recently.; my past project with ES and Kibana didn’t have flask,0
484,1309512,Hassie,How did you build dashboard?,0
484,1309884,Agueda,i built the dashboard with kibana.; flask is only involved in this process b/c it’s generating the event.; i’m just showing how to save data to elastic search in python with a flask view. once you have data in EL then you can use Kibana to do analytics. Kibana could be installed on a totally different server.; hmm.. i could probably PR this elastic search model code i have with this flask extension.; it’s nice mapping a document to a class.,0
484,1309915,Hassie,"Yeah, that will be nice.",0
484,1309953,Agueda,i know it’s a lot of pieces there and gaps but you get started down the path you will get each working :wink:.,0
484,1309989,Hassie,i've few questions.,0
484,1310011,Agueda,k,0
484,1310244,Hassie,"Can you tell me about the architecture part, or process flow.; Is it something like this - 1. User creates an event. 2. Flask view logs data in ES. 3. Kibana gets data from ES and shows it in dashboard.; Aren't you using any async tasks queues like rabbitmq or kafka?",0
484,1310869,Agueda,you could but in the most basic sense you would use the middleware to do a post on elastic search with the data about the event.,0
484,1311019,Hassie,I found this blog post for similar usecase - <http://engineering.hackerearth.com/2015/02/26/logging-millions-requests-what-it-takes/|engineering.hackerearth.com/2015/02/26/logging-millions-requests-what-it-takes/> They used kafka + rabittmq + mongodb + S3 + redshift to build complete architecture; ES will be better than this?,0
484,1311200,Agueda,"oh idk about that. i haven’t used all those before. what i proposed was for something simpler but it could grow to using those things once you need “web scale”. hence, the “logging millions of requests everyday”.",0
484,1311515,Hassie,"okay, thanks :slightly_smiling_face: Now I should connect the dots using the code you provided.; One quick question, how many servers u used? What will be minimal cost to setup this?",0
484,1311618,Agueda,"yea, i’m thinking i may need to do an example app for this now.; do you already have a site you’re trying to integrate this into?; or your just interested in getting it going on your own site?",0
484,1311695,Hassie,I want to integrate it to a website running on Django.,0
484,1311736,Agueda,<https://qbox.io/blog/how-to-elasticsearch-python-django-part1>,0
484,1311916,Hassie,cost involved?,0
484,1311966,Agueda,oh idk the cost we had our own vm infrastructure.,0
484,1311986,Hassie,How many VMs you used?,0
484,1312730,Agueda,there was a central server that ran logstash and the elastic search server with kibana so 2 servers. we also had another server running OSSEC.; it’s been a few years now. i’ve slept since then and don’t remember all the details as i’m not involved in networking admin anymore.; <https://qbox.io/blog/welcome-to-the-elk-stack-elasticsearch-logstash-kibana>; i remember our biggest problem was storage.; there was also grokking all the different kinds of logs.; the one big gripe about ES is that it’s easy to get data in there but hard to take it back out. to combat this while you save a document for EL to index you can also create a record in a relational db. this will help for other kinds of reporting.; for logs we didn’t care about the relational db part. we needed to analyze them in real-time and then archive them.; you can also get ES running super quick with docker.,0
484,1312745,Hassie,Why RDBMS and not MongoDB?,0
484,1313000,Agueda,well ES is already a document store. using something like Mongo would be redundant but i guess if you wanted to you could.; it’s generally not a good idea to try and do things a relational database can do in a document database like joins. i suggested saving to a rdbms in the process mainly so you can take advantage of an rdms at the same time. this won’t be needed for every application.; this is my docker-compose.yml for ES: ``` version: '3' services: elasticsearch: image: nickstenning/elasticsearch-icu ports: - '127.0.0.1:9200:9200' ``` you can type `docker-compose up` and it will start the service for you.,0
484,1313087,Hassie,"So I should store data in both, ES and RDBMS if I want to access it frequently?",0
484,1313157,Agueda,i don’t know what you should do b/c i don’t know the requirements i was just letting you know what you could do :wink:; &gt; i suggested saving to a rdbms in the process mainly so you can take advantage of an rdbms at the same time. this won’t be needed for every application.,0
484,1313385,Hassie,"Hmm. By storing document in RDBMS, did you mean creating schema based on keys in document?",0
484,1313624,Agueda,"yea, you can save the data to the db and get back from the database the inserted record. That would look like this maybe `{""id"": 1, ""name"": ""a1gupta"", ""role"": ""1"", ""created_on"": ""2017-10-11 343434""}`. once you get what the database has you send it to ES.; that’s how you would make a search engine with ES btw. which is what i did recently. you can take those same values in the dict and pass them as query params to a search endpoint.",0
484,1313971,Hassie,Agueda: Thanks . I think I should start now to understand it better. :upside_down_face:,0
484,1315230,Agueda,code it the way you see it :smiley: it looks like there may be a few problems to solve before getting to ES like getting the events you want.; i’m sure there are some django plugins that can help you with that.; ppl in the <#C0LMFRMB5|django> channel would know.,0
497,1630604,Antone,Hi peeps. What is the most state-of-art machine learning technique or research project on learning langauge?,1
497,1630697,Antone,*language (clearly i have a reason for my research),0
497,1630742,Makeda,What do you mean by 'learning language'? This is a VERY wide field; Are you familiar with word2vec? It's not the 'most' state of the art but it represented a big step forward a few years ago and is widely used,2
497,1630777,Makeda,"(You might also reach a more specific audience in <#C2J4B66PK|machine_learning> , but there are fewer people there)",0
499,1647382,Joana,"what's the best way to join on a string x time the same value ?; like `', '.join('hello' for _ in my_list)`; But it seems a bit overkill",1
499,1647531,Anja,Joana: : is there a better way than that?,0
499,1647587,Jae,`'hello ' * n`; where `n` is the number of times to repeat,2
499,1647615,Jung,But won't it add a space at the end?,0
499,1647760,Joana,"Jae: that does each letter; can do that `('hello',) * n`; Jae: I completly missed your point in fact :smile:; got it",0
499,1647781,Dorthey,"`('hello, ' * n).strip(', ')`?; I feel the original was good enough tbh",2
499,1647827,Jung,Wait. Got it :ok_hand:@ndevox,0
499,1647914,Joana,I hoped something existed for that. I'll stay with the for loop more readable,0
831,315,Marna,"in case someone picks this up later, i find myself writing a lot of cypher queries and executing them via tquery, but i'm constantly mapping through results to pluck the :data values and ignore all the other stuff i don't care about (incoming relationships, meta properties, etc.). i'm now resorting to spectre to stay sane. is there a better way?",1
839,68600,Shanelle,"Hey guys, building the first production clj/cljs app for my company. I'm looking for a best practice tip for using Stuart Sierra's component with a (postgres) database connection. ``` (ns my-app.components.db (:require [com.stuartsierra.component :as c] [clojure.java.jdbc :as jdbc])) (defrecord Db [spec connection] c/Lifecycle (start [this] (let [conn (or connection (jdbc/get-connection spec))] (assoc this :connection conn))) (stop [this] (if connection (.close connection)) (assoc this :connection nil))) ``` It happened once in development that after a postgres io error, the connection would close and would render the app db-less. How do you guys handle this / what's a typical db component past the simple examples found online?",1
839,68652,Lila,use a connection pool library instead using the database connection directly; c3p0 is a popular choice,2

841,80003,Dollie,"hey guys, I'm looking forward to design an extensible library. but I'm not sure which is the best approach to it, do you know any reading matterial about this ?",1
841,80346,Eusebio,What's the library's purpose?,0
841,80386,Dollie,a web framework,0
841,80434,Harriette,*hides behind corner* Frameworks are evil.,0
841,80506,Dollie,Harriette: what do you mean ?,0
841,80965,Patricia,"Dollie: if you haven’t already, you should give lispcast’s recent article series on clojure webframeworks a read: <http://www.lispcast.com/why-web-frameworks> , <http://www.lispcast.com/arguments-against-frameworks> , &amp; <http://www.lispcast.com/clojure-web-framework>",2
841,81025,Barbara,Dollie: best library possible is a bunch of little functions that compose correctly (e.g. a domain-specific algebra),2
841,81153,Dollie,"Patricia: thanks, I'll watch them; Barbara: thanks",0
841,81335,Barbara,"maybe one practical example is something like XPath vs. Lenses for traversing data structures; if you design w/ XPath in mind, the API will look one way, w/ Lenses probably another; and will compose differently; (or not at all)",0

841,87664,Patricia,I am not,0
841,87866,Dollie,"it's a good material, but i'm not agree with some of those ideas",0

841,88618,Dollie,"Dong: yeah that's true, At the end of the day frameworks are just tools, there are lots of good and bad tools around; I don't think that not using a framework makes you an expert. It might makes you a fool because your trying to go to a war with a water pistol",0
845,137651,Chanell,"hey guys! I want to read a stream with unknown number of lines (e.g. a file) and fire an async get request per each line (lets say using an http-kit async get with `(go (&gt;! c response))` as a callback). then, read the responses one by one into another file. is there an elegant way of closing the channel making sure I am not missing any async puts into the channel? I can do so with putting my own guard msg at the end but it feels awkward.",1
845,138277,Kymberly,I'm not sure I understand what you're trying to do exactly; any reason why the producer can't just close the channel when the stream runs out?,0
845,141187,Chanell,Kymberly: the producer might close the channel before the last response is put there,0
845,142345,Kymberly,"How so? The producer being (in my mind) the single sequential process that reads from the stream and puts on the channel, it should be able to not close the channel before it's finished reading the stream; maybe you're missing a channel; read file -&gt; channel -&gt; http calls -&gt; channel -&gt; write file ?; if that's the general shape and you want to ensure some parallelism in the ""calls"" step, maybe look at what the `pipeline` functions have to offer in core.async?; I would suppose they already handle closing the channel in the right order",0
848,157886,Loralee,"what is the ""best"" way to store a c3p0 pool to be accessed by multiple namespaces?",1
848,158140,Patricia,"mdrago1026: You can use something like <https://github.com/tolitius/mount> or <https://github.com/stuartsierra/component> to manage complex required system dependencies. Or for something simple like a c3p0 pool, which keeps track of it’s own errors for the most part, I tend to just use something like `(defonce conn-pool (delay (create-c3p0-connection))` and everywhere else you want to refer to it you can `require` the config namespace and reference the pool with `@conn-pool`",2
848,158253,Loralee,awesome. thanks a ton. I will take a look at these,0
848,158494,Patricia,"Loralee: on a very random, unsolicited side note, I prefer <http://brettwooldridge.github.io/HikariCP/> over c3p0. Nothing inherently wrong with c3p0, and I’ve used it in production quite a lot, but hikariCP fits better with what I’m used to in Clojure (in terms of “it just kind of does the correct thing”)",0
848,158626,Loralee,very interesting. let me read up on this. I've heard of Hikari and simply always default to c3p0 since that's what i always have used,0
848,158657,Patricia,"way more than the speed of things (which is not insubstantial), this is why I prefer hikaricp: <https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP/wiki/Pool-Analysis#c3p0>",0

856,231989,Honey,that’s some deep stuff,0
856,232002,Barbara,"&gt; Since Clojure uses the Java calling conventions, it cannot, and does not, make the same tail call optimization guarantees. Instead, it provides the recur special operator, which does constant-space recursive looping",0

878,565536,Amina,"Clojure is a much better language. Erlang is more interesting from a concurrency perspective than an FP one, since the FP there is completely incidental (it was deemed necessary to implement the platform) rather than intentional. Both teach you something new, so if you feel like learning something else after Clojure I can recommend it. I enjoyed my time with Erlang but after 4+ years of it I think I’ve exhausted the platform, and I personally don’t think it’s the right fit in 90% of modern distributed/concurrent system development as a lot of the big selling points (failure handling, concurrency etc.) have been implemented outside of the VM these days and I just think that’s the right way to do it instead of having to think about these explicitly within a service.",0

1263,156395,Shelia,Charlyn: elm-sortable-table does away with the table.update and Table.Msg . You configure a function to transform State -&gt; Msg right? That gets called in the table view… the role of table.update seems to be baked in to the table.view,0
1263,156610,Charlyn,`view : Config data msg -&gt; State -&gt; List data -&gt; Html msg` view is a function that takes a `Config` and a `State` and some data and returns some Html to display; elm-sortable-table exposes functions to operate on the `Config` and `State` values instead of hiding those functions behind `Table.Msg` values being passed to a single `Table.update` function,0
1263,157176,Shelia,"Charlyn: yes. I see that. However, I don’t really see how you extend the pattern to account for the desire to produce a Cmd from the table. IE Lets say i am creating random-sortable-table which i want to handle from within the table… I don’t see where as the author of random-sortable-table i would orchestrate this….; Charlyn: and i know that i am being sloppy with my terminology. because i understand that the table isnt actually producing the random value….",0

1286,294920,Yulanda,Hi! What's the best way to control the selected option of a `select`? I want to set it from the model :thinking_face:,1
1286,295852,Esmeralda,Yulanda: that's done with the `selected` attribute <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/html/2.0.0/Html-Attributes#selected>; so typically you might do something like `List.map (\item -&gt; option [ selected (item == model.activeItem)] [ {- some html -} ]) allItems` in your view,2
1286,296218,Yulanda,"I see, thanks",0
1292,315227,Lea,"Is it considered bad style to create a type with a single constructor wrapping a record? The down side is that you have to pattern match the constructor to get at the record in order to use dot notation. The up side is the strong nominal typing guarantee.; E.g. `type Foo = Foo { x : Int, y : Int }`",1
1292,315655,Lea,I guess Evan also pointed out that wrapping the record can be used to hide the representation from library users. I probably have no need for that in my case.,0
1292,317380,Dyan,"Lea: I would not consider it bad style at all. In our application we tried to do that as much as possible where it made sense, for the reason you described. Elm has great pattern matching, so it's very easy to access said fields in a function definition, etc. E.g ``` myFunc (Foo {x, y}) = x + y ```; If I recall correctly, you don't need the parentheses if you only have one argument; And if you need to reference the entire value again, you can use the `as` keyword: ``` myFunc (Foo {x, y} as fooValue) = ... ```",2
1292,318326,Lea,"Good point, thanks. I have been accessing the record via: ``` myFunc (Foo foo) = foo.x + foo.y ``` ...so that's another option. What's tricky is if you have a list of foos and you want to map an accessor over them.",0
1292,318645,Charlyn,Lea: The common pattern for that is to define a `map` function for your type that applies functions to the unwrapped record value,0
1292,318789,Lea,"That makes total sense, considering it's a separate type, and Elm likes to keep its map functions clearly distinct.",0
1304,419351,Cassaundra,"I'm building a webapp with rails, and I'm looking towards frontend. In the past I've used pure JS (which can be a pain). I've been experimenting with React, and while it's cool, I feel like it's a bit overkill (not to mention if the end-user doesn't enable JS, the whole page breaks). I was looking into integrating elm with existing HTML (instead of replacing everything with elm), which seems to be possible with Elm embeds. However I'm a little confused as to how they interact. Can different elm embeds interact with each other? For instance, if I were to have a persistent audio player similar to the one on soundcloud, could I make that audio player an embed, but have multiple controls for that component in other embeds? Hopefully that makes sense...",1
1304,419777,Yessenia,Cassaundra: Each embedded Elm app would be separate and they would need to communicate using ports just like they would have to if they were communicating with any other JS application. You will need a thin layer of JS in the middle that will coordinate the messages between the various Elm apps that you have. It is quite doable.,2
1304,421223,Charlyn,Cassaundra: of course you can do the same thing with React; I wouldn’t worry to much about people having JS disabled,2
1304,421682,Cassaundra,Yessenia: would that solution still allow me to take advantage of stuff like subscriptions and models (like in the clock example)?,0
1304,421792,Yessenia,"Cassaundra: Yes, standard Elm and in fact incoming ports will come via subscriptions.",0
1304,421977,Cassaundra,do you happen to have any resources on that subject? I can't seem to find much of use but perhaps I'm looking in the wrong places/with the wrong keywords.,0
1304,422178,Yessenia,Cassaundra: Are you talking about ports? I would start here if you haven't read this already: <https://guide.elm-lang.org/interop/javascript.html>,0

1312,470273,Mayola,"hello everyone, I hope you're all great. I would like to ask a general question about Elm ; I'm about to start learning and I'd like to know if I am doing the right choice (even though, considering how everyone trying Elm is in love with it, it must be the right choice at some point anyway :wink: ). So I have 2 questions, my first one is about learning Elm, and the other one is about what you can do once you are able to use it : first, what previous knowledge do you need to learn Elm ? I have an intermediate level in JS, HTML and CSS, and I'm going back to work after a year off so I might be a bit rusty. And then, once you are able to use Elm, what more do you need to learn, to be independant to build a web app? (When I say independant, I mean, by your own, you can build your app, back and front, of course you don't know everything and maybe you'll struggle and ask help on the way but you have the basic knowledge to do it, and to get the knowledge you miss on your way. Versus : some parts are totally obscure to you.) Is it like, what you will learn on your Elm way will teach you what you need to know ? Or do you need to add some back-end and database deep knowledge ? Well, sorry for the long message and thank you very much for your answers :slightly_smiling_face:",1
1312,470493,Shawanda,"Unfortunately at this time you can’t use Elm on the backend, so if your application requires centralized data storage or business logic of some sort, you’ll still need to handle that separately.",2
1312,470608,Mayola,"zgohr, and I've read some things about Elm using Node or compiling to Node or something with Node… it doesn't help?",0
1312,470653,Shawanda,I haven’t looked into it so I’m not sure how viable it would be,0
1312,470679,Mayola,"ok - and so, in other words, what can you exactly do with elm ?",0
1312,470751,Shawanda,Build the front-end of web applications,0
1312,470807,Mayola,"ok, thank you",0
1312,470849,Shawanda,"Very generally, it replaces the use of javascript and html",0
1312,470867,Mayola,"and what about the previous knowledge that you need to start ?; ok, I see",0
1312,470880,Bryce,"Mayola: as for the first question, about previous knowledge... knowing **some** programming language helps, although it's probably not necessary :slightly_smiling_face: today I've heard my friends from one startup say that when they hire somebody to work on their Elm codebase, in two to three weeks he is fully ""caught up"".",2
1312,470883,Mayola,"should I consider it a sort of ""functional react ?""",0
1312,470928,Bryce,Mayola: Elm architecture maps very closely to React+Redux; React = Elm's view Redux = Elm's update+model,0
1312,470988,Mayola,"ok; this is still a bit abstract to me but I think I get the idea; but the guy who fully caught up Elm after few weeks was basically a web dev from other languages, right ?",0
1312,471000,Bryce,yeah; JS guy,0
1312,471210,Mayola,"ok yes; cause right now I'm not at that step, I'm just learning still; as I said, like intermediate JS - html - css level, but not more except many readings that give me some hint of the thing, but nothing like a real experience or a deep knowledge; and I'd like to become independant, so I'm wondering what's the best way to follow (or if it's still too far from me) - i don't intend to be a superstar dev, right now just understanding the whole web app process and being able to do ""something"" with it",0
1312,471273,Shawanda,"wish i could answer you better, it’s pretty hard to generalize about anything. I think it comes down to what your goals are with it; A lot of us come from a javascript background and the preference for Elm comes from the distaste for javascript",0
1312,471419,Mayola,"oh, ok, well personally I like javascript very much basically, maybe there are some real world problems coming from it, but I didn't have to experience them yet; ok and I have just an easy question, what resources do you recommend to learn elm? the one provided on elm's website ?; (or maybe it's not such an easy question, i don't know)",0
1312,471587,Bryce,"Mayola: personally I'd try to do some programming exercises in it (on Exercism or Project Euler or something similar), but there are tutorials: <https://www.elm-tutorial.org/en/> or <https://guide.elm-lang.org/> ... and I'm sure there are others :slightly_smiling_face:",0

1312,471673,Ricki,Thanks very much! I'm looking into this now.,0
1312,471762,Chanelle,Mayola: I think the job pool will be much smaller for Elm unfortunately.; (Not sure if that's an important factor for you.),0
1312,471840,Mayola,"Chanelle: , you're right. I don't really intend to work full time in a company, but I'd like to be able to work as a freelancer. Well I guess the problem is the sae; same",0
1312,471938,Chanelle,I'd say it's worse for freelance work.,0
1312,471950,Mayola,haha good,0
1312,471953,Chanelle,With permanent positions you can seek out companies that use Elm.,0
1312,471969,Mayola,yes you're right; definitely right,0
1312,471993,Chanelle,And those that do will often advertise it since it's a tech that's easy to fall in love (or at least a slight infatuation) with :wink: - so it makes them attractive workplaces.,0

1313,483393,Katie,"Audrey: In general, any language that compiles to Javascript will have an obnoxious time dealing with large integers, since Javascript doesn't have a native integer type. (Maybe things have changed since I last looked, though, due to webasm? I'm not sure)",0
1313,483553,Pamila,Aimee: these types are called Union Types or Algebraic Data Types; depending on the community you're in,0

1313,483685,Katie,"`Cmd Msg` means a command which, when it returns a response, has the ""shape"" of a `Msg`",2

1313,483714,Katie,"You can kind of ignore the parameters when working in your code. For instance, just think of `Cmd Msg` as just.... a command.",0

1313,483847,Aimee,Is there an explanation of this “concept” anywhere?,0
1313,483914,Pamila,read further down the page on the document; the description is there,0
1313,483925,Katie,"The Elm docs won't have any good explanation of the idea. It's a very basic idea from functional programming. Your best bet would probably be to google ""parametric type"" or ""parametrized type"" and look for tutorials on Haskell",2

1313,483972,Katie,(good explanation as in a thorough explanation. The docs will just kind of touch on the idea),0

1313,484054,Katie,"Yeah. ""Generic"" type is another term (although less precise, imo). It's what Java calls the concept.; a more basic example would like `List Int`; It's a list type... a list of what, though? A list of integers.",0
1313,484087,Aimee,I understand “List Int”… a container holding ints. Some of the other ones are still baffling to me.,0

1313,484176,Katie,They are positional parameters,0
1313,484184,Pamila,"no, the position matters",0
1313,484194,Aimee,"I’m more of Python, C and Go guy.",0
1313,484201,Katie,"Just like `foo(x, y)` is not the same as `foo(y, x)` in C; (or Python)",0

1313,484227,Katie,The first position is the flags parameter. `Never` is a special type that signals there are no flags,0

1313,485857,Pamila,Ronnie: so `Window.width` is a task which you use `Task.perform` on to get a `Cmd msg` which you return from update and later receive the message you requested containing the width; you can also subscribe to `Window.resizes` and you will receive a message every time the windows width or height changes; Eryn: Html.keyed is the thing you want I believe,0
1313,486620,Ronnie,"Pamila: gotcha. In this case I’m trying to do (Window.width - Mouse.Position.x). In order to get the messages at the same time, do I need to batch them?",0

1674,130502,Micheline,From the guide section on types (<https://guide.elm-lang.org/types/union_types.html>): &gt; Note: Union types are sometimes called tagged unions. Some communities call them ADTs.,0
1674,130522,Santa,"Micheline: Oh, yeah. That's what actually inspired me. Unfortunately the google map example is currently broken (<https://github.com/rtfeldman/elm-google-maps/issues/1>). I believe the bug is on the component side and there is a workaround.",0
1674,130528,Coy,Santa: <https://github.com/knewter/elm_web_components_playground> is a thing I made,2
1674,130544,Santa,Coy: Thanks .,0
1674,130643,Chrystal,Sure but the generalisation that union types are called ADTs in other languages is not correct. Adt support type variables while union types should not; This is according to TAPL; (Types and Programming Languages book),0
1674,130665,Santa,"My question leans toward practical experience. I'm looking for an alternative to elm-mdl and want something that ""just works"", so I can focus on business logic. I'd like to avoid being on a constant lookout for workarounds.",0
1674,130703,Coy,"Santa: I've built a production app using polymer/web components and elm. There are a few concerns that the talk mentioned above covers, I think. In general, it ""Just Works"" with a few caveats depending on the components you're using.",0
1674,130767,Santa,"Oh, that's great!; Did you use a lot of ""of the shelf"" components, or created your own ones?",0
1674,130840,Micheline,"What Elm refers to ""Union Types"" are allowed to have type variables",0
1674,130865,Chrystal,Exactly. They are ADTs,0
1674,130875,Micheline,yes,0
1674,130885,Santa,Coy: The demo you've linked too looks like a great resource. Thanks ! I'll look deeper into it.,0
1674,130955,Chrystal,Wouldn't it be better to call them what they are? I think it would unify a great abstraction common to many other functional languages,0
1674,131061,Genaro,Yeah! Haskell and Idris should get on board with what Elm and F# call them. :wink: <https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/designing-with-types-single-case-dus/>,0
1674,131493,Chrystal,Probably not happening. I'll see if I can convince the F# and Idris people to name them ADTs :smiling_imp:,0
1674,132056,Santa,Coy: That's a great video . I think I'm sold to at least try it. Also very good point about type safety. I guess it should be quite straight forward to make Elm wrappers for these `nodes` and `attributes`.,0
1677,174931,Susanne,Hello folks! Is anyone aware of a pure elm way to make tooltips? Something like in bootsrap.,1

1693,264295,Anibal,"interesting. I've used bootstrap a lot before, but i think it makes the dom too complicated. I'll check out your links, thanks a lot :slightly_smiling_face:",0

1693,265556,Daniell,yeah! sometimes i wish modules could be relatively namespaced based on the folder they were in. That'd be cool,0

1705,323141,Merrill,"Hello peeps, is there a simplistic way to create a timer in Elm? Literally something as simple as, start at 10, and every second decrement by 1 till you get to zero.",1
1705,323196,Norma,i’d prolly start with something like this: <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/5.1.1/Time#every>,2
1705,323265,Merrill,"I have, my first attempt was using a subscription and running `Time.every second Tick`; however, the event that starts the timer may fall on a sub-second mark, so that first decrement from 10 to 9 doesn't always happen over 1 full second",0
1705,323317,Leia,There's also <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/5.1.1/Process#sleep>,2
1705,323341,Victor,"iirc, there are not many good ways around that (sub second issue), you may want to wait until the first tick and then start counting down.",0
1705,323446,Merrill,"Victor: hmm yeah I was heading towards that solution, was just hoping for something more elegant; there is this... <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/simonewebdesign/elm-timer/latest>",2
1705,323483,Norma,"the suggestion for Process.sleep should work, it isn’t based on the system time but rather a unit of time",0
1705,323537,Merrill,"Norma: I'll have a look into it, may do the job",0
1705,323593,Norma,"hey… whadya know, i have done this already… <https://github.com/mordrax/cotwelm/blob/b72efbb428a6d190ff8a8a9ba61638efa2b8e89e/src/Arena/PlayerArena.elm#L80>; ~hits it every~ waits for 150ms",2
1705,323709,Merrill,"sweet, I'll have a dig into it. I've only been using Elm for a week or two, so still getting my head around it",0
1705,323797,Norma,"ah yeah, wouldn’t suggest you look too deep into that code… i don’t know what i was on when writing that, just how it’s called and threaded back into the Cmd. ianmackenzie is on the ball with `Process.sleep 10000`",0
1705,323908,Merrill,yeah I can't say I quite fully understand what that one line is doing exactly; is it basically sleeping the update function for 150ms?,0
1705,323984,Norma,"haha, ok so you’ve got: <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/5.1.1/Process#sleep> that takes in a `Time` and gives out a `Task` then you’ve got to perform that task <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/5.1.1/Task#perform> which performs a task, and gives you back a msg ( you provide the `a -&gt; msg` function",2
1705,324067,Merrill,"ah right yeah, I see what's happening, you're then passing the message `Sleep (asyncCmd match matches resetCounter) resetCounter`",0
1705,324078,Norma,so all i’m doing here: ``` Task.perform (\_ -&gt; Sleep (asyncCmd match matches resetCounter) resetCounter) (Process.sleep 150) -- summarises to Task.perform (\unused_ -&gt; msg) (Process.sleep 150) ```,0
1705,324079,Merrill,which is then caught `Sleep cmd resetCounter -&gt;`,0
1705,324580,Norma,"exactly, the `msg -&gt; Sleep ...`; so chuck whatever you want to do into that first function `(\unused_ -&gt; msg)`, then thread the output of the Task.peform which is a cmd into your update’s output (<https://github.com/mordrax/cotwelm/blob/b72efbb428a6d190ff8a8a9ba61638efa2b8e89e/src/Arena/PlayerArena.elm#L103>), then you’ve got your msg; There is a purpose to all this madness! See Elm is declarative. Process.sleep doesn’t actually sleep, Task.perform doesn’t actually perform anything. They are all just declaring that, they will do something. You’ll find this with Generators, Decoders, pretty much everything!!!; All these functions are pure, meaning they have no side effects, meaning they don’t do anything. O_O! So unlike in imperative languages where you go sleep 150 and expect it to sleep, here, Process.sleep 150 just gives back a Task that *will* sleep. Then it’s up to you when you call it.; It’s only when you hook up all your declarative functions to the program’s subscription that then allows elm to drive effects through your app",0
1705,324645,Merrill,"it's definitely something to wrap your head around! but I'm honestly enjoying it; just having a look at how I would hook this up in my code, does something like this make sense?; ``` StartGame -&gt; ( { model | status = Playing }, Task.perform (\_ -&gt; Tick) (Process.sleep 1000) ) ```",0
1705,324689,Norma,that should trigger your Tick process ~1000ms after a StartGame msg comes through,0
1705,324715,Merrill,"I know in this situation I'm expecting that Tick will only be called once after 1000ms; alright, the compiler is having a fit haha.",0
1705,324762,Norma,"I say roughly because js has a error margin with setTimeout of &lt; 8ms i think…; if you can’t work it out, chuck the msg here and the community will help, according to some we’re ‘excessively’ helpful",0
1705,324809,Norma,"actually that is true, last time, i needed a foldl which reduced a Result, and got 3 answers in just as many minutes",0
1705,324828,Merrill,"sure, incoming...; ``` The 1st and 2nd branches of this `case` produce different types of values. 12| case msg of 13| Clicked -&gt; 14| if model.status == Playing then 15| processClick model 16| else 17| ( model, Cmd.none ) 18| 19| StartGame -&gt; 20|&gt; ( { model | status = Playing }, Task.perform (\_ -&gt; Tick) (Process.sleep 1000) ) 21| 22| Tick _ -&gt; 23| updateTime model The 1st branch has this type: ( { click_count : Int , click_limit : Int , points : Int , status : Status , targets : List Target , time_elapsed : Int , time_limit : Int } , Cmd (Msg) ) But the 2nd is: ( { click_count : Int , click_limit : Int , points : Int , status : Status , targets : List Target , time_elapsed : Int , time_limit : Int } , Cmd (Time.Time -&gt; Msg) ) ```",0
1705,324903,Norma,"Your Tick tag doens’t have a value, but your update function is expecting one; change ln 22: `Tick -&gt;`",0
1705,324971,Merrill,ah brilliant! good spot :slightly_smiling_face:; that was leftover crud from when I was using `Time.every second Tick`,0
1705,325030,Norma,"yes, you can pass values along with the tick if you want and that’s how you’d do it; `(\_ -&gt; Tick valueToUpdateInASecond)`",0

1720,462472,Janine,"The same way to load it, create a cmd to load the data; don’t think of it as background, I guess, as much as thinking of it as loading it second",0
1720,462493,Ervin,Where do you add the command for it to be in the background? (I am pretty new to Elm),0
1720,462679,Janine,"Sort of a process like this 1) from `init` return the cmd (http request) to load the initial data 2) when the data arrives in your `update`, set it in your model, then return the cmd (next http request) from this `update`; My first pass would be to load it all initially, though, not sorry about it. Get the system working even with the 7 seconds. Then, once you have it working (slowly), then you can start peeling it away.

1720,463594,Laraine,"Gigi: wow! I've just seen `elm-benchmark` in action. I'm blown away - super useful library, thanks so much Hicks :smile: . <https://elmseeds.thaterikperson.com/elm-benchmark>",0
1721,464372,Lin,Hi all; I have an app (dashboard with widgets) in which I'm constantly editing the model and then running PUT requests to save it; I'm wondering what's the best way to be sure all the save requests are executed in the right order; (with js I was storing a promise and chaining future requests to the globally saved promise inside a service); is it possible to have something like saving a Task is the model and adding andThen at each update ?; and of course I also want to use debouncing and I'm wondering how to best implement it (there seem to be several libraries on the subject but do you have any recommandation?),1
1721,464413,Liberty,"you can store a `Task` in the model and andThen, but the task isn't actually evaluated when you do that",2
1721,464428,Laraine,<http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/5.1.1/Task#sequence>,2
1721,464480,Liberty,"also, elm is fundamentally asynchronous, so you'll have to deal with that; one solution could be to wait till the put request is finished before sending the next one",0
1721,464732,Lin,"yes that's what I want to do (what I'm doing actually in js today); when I need to save a new version, I get my promise and use a `promise = promise.then(() =&gt; { return model.put(); }`; using Task sequence seems right in elm but the first task needs to start as soon as possible, but if a second one arrives it must wait for the first one to complete",0
1721,464742,Michelina,Are there any ways to create a nontrival Task (ie not one created through succeed or fail) in the core package?,0
1721,464767,Liberty,Michelina: define non-trivial?,0
1721,464774,Michelina,I did :X,0
1721,464804,Liberty,"well, you can combine primitives with `map` and `andThen`; so, yes",0
1721,464909,Michelina,"`map` and `andThen` both require you already have a `Task`... so I guess to be more precise, one which does not contain any reference to `succeed` or `fail`. So `map (\x -&gt; x) (succeed True)` wouldn't really count, either.",0
1721,464947,Liberty,"Lin: so I think you need to pick some nice data type to model what you want to do, for instance `type BackupRequest a = Sending { waiting : Maybe (Task Http.Error a) } | Done `",2
1721,464948,Lin,"it seems I need to chain Cmd, not Tasks, which is not possible without a custom manual implementation... ?",0
1721,464961,Liberty,"for custom stuff, tasks are the way to go",0
1721,464991,Michelina,"Ah, it looks like the `Process` module exposes a few",0
1721,465006,Liberty,"Michelina: well, `Time.now`",0
1721,465009,Lin,"yes but once the task is started (attempt ?), you can't use it any more for `andThen`",0
1721,465029,Liberty,TRUE; so you create a new empty task,0
1721,465044,Lin,what for?,0
1721,465067,Liberty,"actually, create a new task, that will be the next put",0
1721,465089,Michelina,"Maybe I'm wrong, but `Task`s seem like they would be well-suited for working with random numbers.",0
1721,465123,Liberty,"then as long as we're waiting for the server, swapping out that task with a newer version when the model is updated. once the request resolves, send the new task",0
1721,465188,Lin,"yes that's even an improved version; but the implementation is completely manual, no help form the core library",0
1721,465243,Liberty,what would you like to see in core? it seems simple enough to implement and may give you material to publish a package,0
1721,465335,Lin,"not sure to be at the package level yet :wink:; but yes ok I'll try something like that with a pendingModelToBeSaved, swapping it with a new one when an update is made",0
1721,465480,Janine,"For the data that changes, we usually have it in a type like (simplified) ``` type Savable a = Saved a | Saving a ``` Then, when a save is triggered, we don’t do it until it makes it back to `Saved` If you want to have a way to say “I want to save it when finished” then you can add another state to it, something like `SavePending`; So, the code only creates the PUT if it is in `Saved` state",0

1721,466544,Perla,Johnson: I’m wondering what the absolute timings in your benchmark are. I’ve found that for very short tasks things like requestAnimationFrame can add noise to Elm results; another thing that chrome tools can help tell you…,0

1721,466666,Neoma,Is there a library for generating ids?,0
1721,466722,Joni,"Perla: elm-benchmark uses interleaved samples of sufficient size, requestanimationframe isn't really that relevant here :slightly_smiling_face: (and the high-precision timing api)",0

1721,466763,Joni,"<https://github.com/BrianHicks/elm-benchmark#how-are-my-benchmarks-measured> it's pretty cool, actually",0

1721,467337,Coreen,"Johnson: responding here since the conversation has moved on a ways. The things that cause high stddev are usually other processes running or window painting happening. Browser benchmarks are tricky since it's basically a miniature operating system inside another OS.; so: quit browser tabs, run in an incognito window if you have a lot of extensions, and quit any electron apps (especially Slack, which spikes CPU randomly.); I'm happy to answer more questions in <#C3Y7SC0HF|elm-benchmark>; threads are a bit awkward :stuck_out_tongue:",0
1721,467350,Neoma,"I may want to account for situation where in the interim the user can re-order the tree (for non-unique names of course), hence even though the path is fixed for now, path is not a universal solution.",0
1721,467704,Sunny,I see; Random ids are going to require a task or some sort,0
1721,468400,Laraine,not necesarely. you can use `step` function - is pseudo random - meaning if you call it with the same inputs you get the same outputs. See this mgold package. But you have a seed which you can store on your model - and you update the seed - and place it back on the model - every time you generate this random id. <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/mgold/elm-random-pcg/5.0.0/Random-Pcg#step>,0

1736,606328,Santa,Hello! I want to fork and hack on an Elm library simultaneously with building my application and eventually PR the upstream repo. How would I set this up locally? In NPM land I would use `npm link`. Are there any established practices for Elm?,1
1736,606562,Joni,you could use `elm_self_publish.py` found here: <https://github.com/NoRedInk/elm-ops-tooling>; which allows you to locally install a package into another package,2
